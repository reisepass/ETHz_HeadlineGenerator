	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand expects 39 countries, regions
or organizations to send teams to the Asian Games, but is still
waiting for confirmation from Tajikistan, Mongolia and a
Palestinian team, the games' organizers said Monday.
	   Only Afghanistan is certain not to participate, said a press
release from the organizing committee of the Dec. 6-20 games in
Bangkok.
	   The lists submitted by participants so far show 8,804 athletes
and officials planning to come to the games, the statement said,
adding that the eventual number is expected to be 10,000.
	   It said the Olympic Council of Asia, the region's governing
sports body, had been in close contact with Tajikistan, Mongolia
and the Palestinians.
	   ``We will wait for their final reply until Nov. 20,'' it quoted
Warawut Sumon, head of Thailand's technical committee, as saying.
``At the same time, we are taking into consideration that some
teams may not make it to the regional games.''
	   Last week, Afghanistan said it would not send a team to the
games because it could not afford the expense. It added that its
sports minister and a second representative might show up to carry
the flag as a ceremonial gesture.
	   The organizers also said Monday that the Olympic Council of Asia
and the International Olympic Committee are both withholding
recognition of Afghanistan's national organizing committee for the
games because two separate parties claim to represent it.
	   All programs, participation and budgetary allocations for
Afghanistan's committee have been frozen, it quoted Abdul Muttaleb
Ahmad, OCA director general, as saying.
	   Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej, meanwhile, received Thai
athletes and organizers Monday at his palace, and wished them good
luck and success.
	   ``Even though the country has faced financial trouble, Thailand
has shown the watching world that the crisis cannot be an obstacle
if there is sincerity and harmony among Thais to make this major
event happen,'' he added.
