	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Organizers of the Olympic Games in
Salt Lake City are not to blame for a bribery scandal that has
embarrassed the Olympic movement, but were victims of blackmail,
the Swiss official who made the allegations said Monday.
	   Marc Hodler, a senior International Olympic Committee official,
has accused Salt Lake City of funding a scholarship program to give
athletic training and academic aid to youngsters from developing
countries in order to win votes during its successful bid to host
the 2002 Winter Games.
	   At an emotional news conference Monday, Hodler said Salt Lake
City was not to blame for the alleged corruption.
	   ``For us, Salt Lake City was a victim of blackmail and not a
villain,'' he said. ``The real villains are the agents who put the
cities in awkward positions using blackmail. ... Salt Lake City had
been forced by blackmail to give financial favors.''
	   On Saturday, Hodler accused four ``agents'' _ including one IOC
member _ of involvement in vote-buying over the past 10 years. He
cited alleged irregularities in the selections of at least three
other Olympic cities _ Atlanta; Nagano, Japan, and Sydney,
Australia.
	   Hodler accused the Salt Lake bid committee of operating a fund
that provided nearly dlrs 400,000 in aid to 13 people, including
six relatives of IOC members.
	   Hodler said he decided to go public after a senior Swiss
government official asked him about ``rumors'' of misconduct and
wondered whether Hodler had been bribed to keep quiet.
	   Until now, there had only been rumors of bribery that could not
be documented, Hodler said, including complaints from previous
unsuccessful Olympic bidders like Manchester, England, and
Stockholm and Ostersund in Sweden.
	   But now there was written proof of corruption in the case of the
Salt Lake fund, Hodler said.
	   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, appearing at the same news
conference, said the Olympic committee was investigating only the
Salt Lake City case because it was the only one with documented
evidence.
	   ``If there is other proof, we will open other cases,'' he said.
	   Samaranch said he was confident the IOC would survive the
scandal and promised to act quickly against any corrupt members.
	   On Sunday, Samaranch said the scandal could be the catalyst for
needed reform and changes in the way Olympic host cities are
selected to remove the risks of bribery.
	   ``If we have to clean (things up), we will,'' Samaranch said.
``If it is necessary, we will expel members. ... After, the IOC
will be even stronger than before.''
