	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ What started as a local controversy
in Salt Lake City has evolved into a full-blown international
scandal.
	   The International Olympic Committee has ordered a top-level
investigation into the payment of nearly dlrs 400,000 in
scholarships to relatives of IOC members by the Salt Lake group
which won the bid for the 2002 Winter Games.
	   IOC executive board member Marc Hodler said the scholarship fund
_ described as ``humanitarian aid'' by Salt Lake officials _
amounted to a ``bribe.''
	   ``I'm terribly sorry that even Salt Lake City _ by far the best
place to hold the winter games _ had to use certain methods in
order to get the vote,'' Hodler said.
	   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch assigned the international
body's juridical commission _ which deals with legal and ethical
issues _ to investigate.
	   The inquiry will be headed by IOC vice president Keba Mbaye of
Senegal, a highly respected former World Court judge.
	   The scholarship fund was first disclosed two weeks ago by a Salt
Lake radio station.
	   The controversy is now bound to overshadow the routine progress
report which the Salt Lake Olympic Committee (SLOC) is scheduled to
make to the IOC executive board this weekend.
	   ``It is clearly disappointing and this is an issue that can only
be described as disruptive at a critical time of importance for
Salt Lake City,'' said John Krimsky, deputy secretary general of
the U.S. Olympic Committee. ``I would hope whatever the IOC and
president Samaranch decide, this is resolved quickly so people
charged with organizing the games can get back to business.''
	   Salt Lake organizers have denied that the bid committee's dlrs
500,000 project was an effort to buy key IOC members' support in
the four years between IOC votes on the 1998 and 2002 games.
	   Salt Lake lost the '98 race to Nagano, Japan, in 1991, when the
program was begun. It won a landslide vote over Sion, Switzerland,
for the 2002 Games in the 1995 balloting.
	   In that interim, the bid committee _ under the direction of
former president Thomas Welch _ spent nearly dlrs 400,000 on
scholarships to 13 individuals _ six of them relatives of IOC
members, mostly from Africa.
	   SLOC said the money went toward tuition assistance, books,
living expenses and athletic training.
	   Among those identified as receiving scholarship funds was Sonia
Essomba, the daughter of the late Rene Essomba of Cameroon. The
elder Essomba, a prominent surgeon, was the secretary general of
the National Olympic Committees of Africa.
	   Salt Lake organizers have refused to identify the other IOC
relatives who received scholarships.
	   Hodler, a Swiss lawyer who heads the IOC oversight panel on the
2002 games and has often been effusive in his praise for Salt
Lake's Olympic preparations, feels the project was unethical.
	   ``It's not wrong to say it's a bribe _ it is a bribe,'' he said.
``It's a bribe, yes.''
	   Sion, in the Alps south of Lausanne, is running again for the
2006 Winter Games.
	   ``I just came back from a Sion meeting and they're very proud
people and said they can do it without bribes,'' Hodler said.
	   Following allegations of bribery and other influence peddling in
previous Olympic votes, the IOC assigned Hodler to draw up new
rules and restrictions to weed out the possibility of corruption.
	   ``The rules are very clear: gifts should not be higher than dlrs
100,'' he said. ``If (the Salt Lake scholarship fund) is a gift,
that gift is irregular. If it would be connected with the voting,
of course, it's corruption.''
	   It's unclear what sanctions _ if any _ could be taken against
Salt Lake if the IOC investigation finds irregularities.
	   ``Can we take the games away from Salt Lake City?'' Hodler said.
``Does that make sense? I can't propose it because in that case
people will say Sion will get it free of charge. I'm a Swiss and
Sion was No. 2 (in the vote).''
	   Hodler said he will propose that only the 11-member IOC
executive board and leaders of sports federations select Olympic
cities _ rather than the full IOC assembly.
	   Hodler said he pushed through a similar change when he was
president of the International Ski Federation, where, he said,
``there was also a lot of corruption.''
	   Hodler said he would also propose that any IOC member found
guilty of accepting favors should be expelled from the
organization.
