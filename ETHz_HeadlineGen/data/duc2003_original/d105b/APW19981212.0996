	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The board of trustees overseeing
the Salt Lake City Olympics will meet in emergency session next
week to dicuss the controversy surrounding alleged rules violations
involving the bid for the 2002 Winter Games.
	   The board's executive committee will meet in Salt Lake next
Friday. The board had not planned to meet again until Jan. 14.
	   Salt Lake spokesman Frank Zang said Saturday that the meeting
was moved up at the urging of organizing committee president Frank
Joklik so members could be apprised of the situation.
	   ``There is only one item on the agenda _ this,'' said John
Krimsky, U.S. Olympic Committee's deputy secretary general,
referring to the controversy.
	   The IOC opened a high-level investigation Friday into alleged
misconduct by the Salt Lake bid committee, which won the right to
stage the 2002 games.
	   The controversy centers on a scholarship fund _ described as
``humanitarian aid'' by Salt Lake officials. The program provided
nearly dlrs 400,000 in tuition and other assistance to 13
individuals _ including six relatives of IOC members, mostly from
Africa.
	   Senior Swiss IOC member Marc Hodler, who heads the IOC's
oversight panel for the 2002 games, has described the fund as a
``bribe'' to sway the votes of IOC members. Salt Lake won the games
by a landslide in the 1995 election.
	   Joklik, senior vice president Dave Johnson and other officials
met for 90 minutes Friday night with the IOC panel investigating
the case. Neither side commented on the substance of the meeting.
	   Asked to sum up the mood of the Salt Lake officials, Krimsky
said, ``I wouldn't call it jovial, but they were stable.''
	   Zang said late Saturday there had been no more meetings with the
IOC panel since Friday.
	   ``We're in a holding pattern,'' he said. ``We're on call and
ready to meet with the IOC whenever we're asked.''
	   Officials said they don't expect the inquiry to be wrapped up by
the end of the IOC executive board meetings here Monday.
	   Officials have declined to speculate on what _ if any sanctions
_ could be taken against Salt Lake.
	   In Utah, government were cautious about commenting on the
possible fallout of the bribery allegations.
	   ``We simply don't have enough perspective right now,'' said
Vicki Varela, spokeswoman for Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt. ``The hope is
that as we all have more information, the integrity of the bid as a
whole will remain intact.''
	   ``All we can do is try to maintain quality services and do a
positive campaign saying that Salt Lake City is different from the
Salt Lake Olympics,'' said Bryce Jolley, chairman of the City
Council.
	   The investigation has completely overshadowed Salt Lake's report
to the IOC on preparations for the games.
	   On Sunday, SLOC officials will seek the executive board's
approval for their new dlrs 1.453 billion budget, final competition
schedule and any venue changes.
	   In addition, organizers are expected to ask for the board's
endorsement for Salt Lake's long-delayed mascot _ or mascots. The
official launch of the mascot is scheduled for February.
	   Hodler contested the argument by the current Salt Lake
organizing committee that it was not directly involved in the
controversial scholarship program and that the onus was on former
bid chief Thomas Welch.
	   ``Yesterday the lawyer of Salt Lake City said, `Everything had
been done by Tom Welch, who is not there anymore. We know nothing.'
My experience is that this is not true,'' Hodler said.
	   Joklik was chairman of the bid committee at the time. Johnson
also was a high official on the bid panel.
	   Welch resigned as SLOC president last year after allegations of
domestic violence against his wife.
