	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The IOC opened a high-level
investigation Thursday into what one top Olympic official described
as ``bribes'' paid by the Salt Lake City bid committee to help
secure the 2002 Winter Games.
	   International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch
ordered a probe into the scholarship payments made to relatives of
IOC members in the lead-up to the vote for the games.
	   ``This is quite clearly a matter to investigate,'' IOC director
general Francois Carrard said.
	   The investigation will be led by Keba Mbaye of Senegal, a former
World Court judge who heads the IOC's commission dealing with legal
and ethical issues.
	   ``The president sent me a letter asking me to carry out an
investigation and report to the executive board,'' Mbaye said. ``We
will start immediately.''
	   Salt Lake organizers have denied the bid committee's dlrs
500,000 ``humanitarian aid'' project was an effort to buy key IOC
members' support in the four years between the IOC votes on the
1998 and 2002 games.
	   Salt Lake lost to Nagano, Japan, in 1991, when the program was
begun. It won a landslide vote over Sion, Switzerland, for the 2002
Games in the 1995 vote.
	   In that interim, the bid committee _ under the direction of
former president Thomas Welch _ spent nearly dlrs 400,000 on
scholarships to 13 individuals _ six of them relatives of IOC
members, mostly from Africa.
	   ``It's not wrong to say it's a bribe _ it is a bribe,'' said IOC
executive board member Marc Hodler, a Swiss lawyer who heads the
oversight panel for the Salt Lake Olympics. ``It's a bribe, yes.''
	   ``I'm terribly sorry that even Salt Lake City _ by far the best
place to hold the winter games _ had to use certain methods in
order to get the vote,'' he said.
	   Hodler suggested that, in different circumstances, there might
have been grounds to consider taking the games away from the Utah
capital.
	   ``Can we take the games away from Salt Lake City?'' he said.
``Does that make sense? I can't propose it because in that case
people will say Sion will get it free of charge. I'm a Swiss and
Sion was No. 2 (in the vote).''
	   Pressed on the issue, he said, ``That's very difficult. I don't
see anyone who could take the games in three years and make it
successful. Also, the chairman (of the Salt Lake committee) has
changed and you might be punishing the wrong man.''
	   Asked if irregularities were common in the Olympic bidding
process, Hodler said, ``I had thought we had a very small
percentage of (IOC) members exposed to such things. Apparently
there are more.''
	   ``I just came back from a Sion meeting and they're very proud
people and said they can do it without bribes,'' he said.
	   Following allegations of bribery and other influence peddling in
previous Olympic votes, the IOC assigned Hodler to draw up new
rules and restrictions to weed out the possibility of corruption.
	   ``The rules are very clear: gifts should not be higher than dlrs
100,'' he said. ``If (the Salt Lake scholarship fund) is a gift,
that gift is irregular. If it would be connected with the voting,
of course, it's corruption.''
	   As a result of the Salt Lake controversy, Hodler said he will
propose that only the 11-member IOC executive board and leaders of
sports federations select Olympic cities _ rather than the full IOC
assembly.
	   Hodler said he pushed through a similar change when he was
president of the International Ski Federation, where, he said,
``there was also a lot of corruption.''
	   Hodler said he would also propose that any IOC member found
guilty of accepting favors should be expelled from the
organization.
	   The payments controversy is bound to overshadow the routine
progress report which the Salt Lake Organizing Committee (SLOC) is
scheduled to make to the IOC board this weekend. SLOC president
Frank Joklik and his team are scheduled to arrive Friday.
	   ``It is clearly disappointing and this is an issue that can only
be described as disruptive at a critical time of importance for
Salt Lake City,'' said John Krimsky, deputy secretary general of
the U.S. Olympic Committee. ``I would hope whatever the IOC and
president Samaranch decide, this is resolved quickly so people
charged with organizing the games can get back to business.''
	   Among those identified as receiving scholarship funds was Sonia
Essomba, the daughter of the late Rene Essomba of Cameroon. The
elder Essomba, a prominent surgeon, was the secretary general of
the National Olympic Committees of Africa.
	   Joklik, in outlining an audit of the program for reporters
Tuesday, refused to identify the other IOC relatives who received
scholarships.
