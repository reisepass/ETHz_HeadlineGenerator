	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The Olympic executive whose
accusations of bribery and blackmail rocked the IOC says as many as
25 members might have received favors or cash for votes in four
recent elections to choose sites for the games.
	   ``That's the absolute maximum because I trust all the others,''
Marc Hodler was quoted as saying in Wednesday's editions of USA
Today. The International Olympic Committee has 115 members.
	   Hodler, an 80-year-old senior member of the IOC executive board,
has not identified any IOC members who may have taken bribes.
	   The IOC began investigating the successful bid by Salt Lake City
for the 2002 Winter Olympics after Salt Lake organizers disclosed
they had made payments of nearly dlrs 400,000 in scholarship funds
to 13 people, including six relatives of IOC members.
	   Hodler also said Salt Lake organizers have turned over 25 pages
listing payments in its ``humanitarian assistance'' program.
	   ``They've got a lot of information. They're not limited to the
scholarships,'' Hodler told the newspaper.
	   Hodler said the new summary details dls 630,000 in payments,
some of it unrelated to IOC members.
	   Earlier, Hodler said he went public Saturday with allegations of
corruption in the Olympic bidding process because he feared a
cover-up of the Salt Lake scandal.
	   ``The feeling crept up on me that certain people are afraid of
this case and wanted to sweep everything under the carpet,'' Hodler
told the Zurich daily Neue Zuercher Zeitung on Wednesday.
	   ``Because of various misunderstandings, I was under the
impression that some of my colleagues might try not to uncover
mistakes made by some members of the IOC and lay all the blame on
the Salt Lake City organizing committee,'' he also told Zurich's
Tages-Anzeiger daily. ``I'm not acting for Salt Lake City but for
justice.''
	   Hodler said Saturday that Salt Lake City had been
``blackmailed'' by agents promising to secure votes during its
Olympic bid. He said four agents, including one member of the IOC,
had been involved in vote-buying schemes over the past 10 years.
	   He cited supposed irregularities in the elections of at least
four Olympic cities _ Atlanta; Nagano, Japan; Sydney, Australia;
and Salt Lake.
	   ``In don't enjoy being a member of a club that has a bad
reputation,'' Hodler told the Neue Zuercher Zeitung.
	   ``I'm a lawyer and, as such, I can't do anything without proof.
In contrast to what you might believe, I'm probably the best friend
of IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch.''
	   Hodler said he wanted to ``exert pressure'' on the IOC to change
its election procedure for Olympic cities, putting the decision in
the hands of a small group rather than the entire IOC membership.
