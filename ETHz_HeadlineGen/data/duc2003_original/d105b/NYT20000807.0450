   The two chief organizers of Salt Lake City's bid to be host to
the 2002 Winter Olympics pleaded not guilty on Monday to federal
charges that they had conspired to bribe members of the
International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants, Tom Welch, former president of the Salt Lake
City bid committee, and Dave Johnson, his chief deputy, said they
were eager to defend themselves in federal district court. A trial
date was set for Oct. 16 in Salt Lake City, but defense lawyers
said they would ask for a delay of up to a year to gather evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Welch and Johnson maintain that they violated no laws in paying
more than $1 million to IOC delegates and their families in the
form of cash payments, scholarships, medical treatment and
expensive gifts. The two have repeatedly said they were simply
conducting business that had become customary for cities bidding on
the Olympics. Their lawyers have indicated that they want a delay
in the trial so they can question IOC delegates to show that it was
common to shower them with exorbitant favors.
</P>
<P>
   The two bid officials have also said they acted with the
knowledge of the Salt Lake City business and political community.
Evidence uncovered in news reports last year clearly indicated that
there was widespread awareness of at least some of their
activities. A trial could prove extremely embarrassing to the
community and its leaders as they prepare to play host to the 2002
Winter Games in 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Welch and Johnson face one count of conspiracy to bribe, five
counts of mail fraud, five counts of wire fraud and four counts of
interstate travel in aid of racketeering. The charges carry a
maximum of 75 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not do anything that violated the law,'' Welch told
reporters outside the federal courthouse in Salt Lake City. ``We
did not do anything that other cities hadn't done. We didn't do
things that should embarrass this community. I think that not only
will we be vindicated and found not guilty, but history will put it
in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Welch, 55, and Johnson, 41, have said the cash payments were
made to help impoverished athletes in developing nations. However,
evidence has shown that a good deal of the money went directly into
the pockets of IOC delegates. Ten resigned or were forced out of
their positions last year. In an effort to reform the bidding
process, IOC members are now forbidden to visit cities bidding on
the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 of the I.O.C.'s 113 delegates have been implicated in
some form of misconduct regarding bidding on the Games. Revelations
have shown that similar bidding practices occurred in other
successful bid cities, including Atlanta, Sydney, Australia, and
Nagano, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the thorniest charge facing Welch and Johnson concerns
$130,000 from a New York travel agency, Jet Set Sports, that
prosecutors say the two men diverted for personal use. Lawyers for
Welch and Johnson said the money was used for bidding purposes. Jet
Set Sports later became an official travel agent for the 2002
Winter Games.  &QL;
