   NEW YORK _ In the second and final debate in the race for state
attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, the Democratic challenger, accused
Republican incumbent Dennis Vacco on Sunday of ignoring the threat
posed by radical anti-abortion advocates, thereby helping to ease
the way for this weekend's slaying of an obstetrician.
</P>
<P>
   The obstetrician, Dr. Barnett Slepian, was killed by a sniper on
Friday night at his home in a Buffalo suburb. Spitzer seized on the
shooting again and again during their half-hour debate, which was
broadcast live on WABC-TV in Manhattan and shown on other network
affiliates across the state.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer cited a ruling in 1992 in which a federal judge rebuked
Vacco, who was then the U.S. attorney for western New York, for
failing to pursue contempt charges when protesters violated a court
order against blocking the entrance to a clinic where Slepian was
working. The judge, Richard Arcara of Buffalo, took the rare step
of removing Vacco from the case and replacing him with two special
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer, speaking of his opponent, said, ``The horror that
occurred the other night should weigh heavily on his conscience.''
He also chided Vacco for getting rid of the Office of Reproductive
Rights when he became attorney general. ``Mr. Vacco disbanded the
very unit that was to protect this doctor,'' Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco responded heatedly, assailing his opponent for exploiting
the slaying for political purposes. ``I think it borders on being
despicable that Mr. Spitzer would try to seek political advantage
at the expense of Dr. Slepian and Dr. Slepian's family,'' Vacco
said.
</P>
<P>
   The incumbent, who is personally opposed to abortion, cited his
successful effort to win a U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding a
ban on blocking abortion clinics.
</P>
<P>
   After the debate, Kelli Conlin, executive director of the New
York chapter of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights
Action League, said that the case was started under Vacco's
predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Sunday's debate was even nastier than the first
one, which was held in Woodbury, N.Y., on Friday. Vacco continued
hammering Spitzer for refusing to explain inconsistencies regarding
his campaign loans.
</P>
<P>
   Less than halfway through the debate, Vacco offered to yield the
rest of his time to Spitzer if he would reconcile his campaign
spending. At issue is Spitzer's claim that he had used eight
cooperative apartments he owns in Manhattan as collateral for
millions of dollars of campaign loans with a document submitted to
the state by his father, Bernard Spitzer. Before the cameras, Vacco
waved a document in which the father, a real estate developer, had
sworn that the apartments were not being used as collateral.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested Spitzer was being less than candid about the source
of his campaign financing. ``Show us the money,'' Vacco pleaded.
</P>
<P>
   As he did in the Friday debate, Spitzer provided only a
bare-bones response. ``The documents have been submitted,'' he
said. ``The response is very simple, Mr. Vacco: You're wrong on the
facts, you're wrong on the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by reporters to say more on the issue after the debate,
Spitzer said he would ``answer the facts at the right time'' and
declined to elaborate.

<P>
   Since those two issues occupied most of the half-hour allotted
to the debate, the candidates had little time to spell out their
ideological differences. Spitzer once again accused Vacco of
diminishing the stature of the attorney general's office, pointing
to reports that 80 percent of the people hired since Vacco took
over in 1994 had political connections. Vacco sought to deflect
that criticism by enumerating his accomplishments in fighting crime
and other areas.
</P>
<P>
   After the debate, two political analysts _ one a Republican, the
other an independent _ said Spitzer's handling of the questions
about his finances had harmed his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's so easy to explain, why didn't he remove it from the
menu?'' said Jay Severin, the Republican strategist.
</P>
<P>
   John Zogby, an independent pollster in Utica, N.Y., said that if
Spitzer made a simple technical error, he has compounded it by his
reticence. ``That could be one of the things that causes Spitzer to
sputter,'' he said. ``I think he's handled it very badly.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Severin said, Spitzer did well by responding
so quickly to Slepian's slaying. ``It is evidence of some skill
politically that he was able to seize on it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since polls indicate that two of three New York voters favor
abortion rights, Zogby said, it was a smart move for Spitzer to
home in on the shooting as a way to attract Democrats, moderate
Republicans and women to the polls.
