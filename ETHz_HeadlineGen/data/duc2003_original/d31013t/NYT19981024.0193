   Dr. Barnett Slepian, an obstetrician with a practice in suburban
Buffalo, N.Y., returned home from synagogue Friday night with his
wife, Lynn, and greeted his four sons. Then he stepped into his
kitchen, where a sniper's bullet crashed through a back window and
struck him in the chest, police said.
</P>
<P>
   He fell to the floor, calling for help, but he would die within
two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian was one of a handful of doctors who provide abortions in
the Buffalo area, and law-enforcement officials said Saturday that
his slaying was the most deadly example of what they described as
an annual pattern of anti-abortion violence in Canada and western
New York. Slepian had endured years of picketing and harassment,
and earlier on Friday he had received a warning about possible
attacks against abortion providers.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian, 51, is the third abortion doctor killed in the United
States since 1993. In the past four years, three Canadian doctors
and a doctor in Rochester, N.Y., all of whom performed abortions,
have been wounded by snipers. Each of the shootings occurred within
a few weeks of Nov. 11, Veteran's Day, also known as Remembrance
Day in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Saturday that he was ``outraged'' by
Slepian's slaying and that the Justice Department was working with
local authorities to track down his killer.
</P>
<P>
   New York Gov. George Pataki said the killer should face the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beyond a tragedy _ it's really an act of terrorism and,
in my mind, a cold-blooded assassination,'' Pataki said in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Ward, a spokeswoman for Buffalo GYN Women's Services, the
private clinic where Slepian performed abortions, said the National
Abortion Federation had faxed a warning to the clinic Friday
morning reminding them about the four-year pattern of attacks. Ms.
Ward said the fax was sent to Slepian at his private office in
Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was aware of the threat,'' she said. ``Around this time of
year, there had been shootings.''
</P>
<P>
   Amherst police said the timing of the shootings was not the only
similarity. In each case, police said a gunman, using a
high-powered rifle, fired through a window into the home of the
doctors. Last November, a doctor in Winnipeg, Manitoba, was shot in
the shoulder by a bullet fired through a window.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Police Chief Frank Olesko said local investigators as
well as FBI agents and Canadian authorities were looking at the
possibility that the same gunman could be responsible for all of
the shootings. A task force of several Canadian and U.S. law
enforcement agencies has been investigating the attacks for more
than a year.
</P>
<P>
   National abortion-rights advocates expressed concern that the
slaying signaled a renewed escalation of violence against abortion
providers.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman who shot Slepian apparently hid in a strip of woods
behind the house, then fired a single shot from a high-powered
rifle, Olesko said. Local police, FBI agents and Canadian
investigators searched the woods Saturday, but the identity and
whereabouts of the suspect remained unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Shalom Press, another Amherst abortion provider who had known
Slepian for years, said, ``He believed women had the right to have
an abortion, and he followed his conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   The slaying comes more than six years after anti-abortion
protesters descended on Buffalo. In April 1992, the city was the
setting for a coordinated series of ``Spring of Life'' protests led
by members of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue. Nearly 200
protesters were arrested during one demonstration, and
abortion-rights groups held counter protests. Police said Slepian
was one of the doctors singled out by picketers.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with The Buffalo News, Slepian said he took the
rhetoric of abortion opponents seriously.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1993, one month after the shooting death of a
Pensacola, Fla., abortion provider, David Gunn, Slepian spoke about
the vulnerability of doctors who provide abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably hits home a little bit because it could have been
me,'' Slepian told The Buffalo News. ``For years I've felt, and I
still feel, it could happen to me or to someone around here.''
</P>
<P>
   And in 1995, he told The News: ``When you're using words like
`kill' and `murder,' that's where it can lead. If the
rosary-holding churchgoers and the bishop don't think that's true,
they're fooling themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Slepian had clashed with anti-abortion protesters
outside his home. Protesters had taunted him during the Jewish
holiday of Hanukkah, calling him a ``murderer.'' One protester
later claimed that Slepian had attacked him with a baseball bat,
though the case was later settled.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian divided his practice between the clinic in Buffalo and
his private office in Amherst. Ms. Ward, the clinic spokeswoman,
said he had worked at that and other clinics for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been harassed right in front of his house,'' she said.
``His children have been harassed.'' She called him a courageous
man who followed his principles.
</P>
<P>
   A woman from Attica, N.Y., who identified herself only as Susan,
stood outside his Amherst office Saturday, weeping. She said
Slepian should not be portrayed solely as an ``abortion doctor.''
She said he had delivered her niece and her daughter and that he
kept a photo album of the hundreds of babies that he had delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, he was about babies, not abortion,'' Susan said. She
said she had gone to him every three months for the past four years
for treatment of cervical cancer. ``I feel he saved my life. I feel
he is like a member of my family.''
</P>
<P>
   In Slepian's affluent Amherst neighborhood of large homes, there
was a sense of shock that this protected world could be violated.
The slogan on Amherst police cars reads, ``Safest Town in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every once in a while,'' said David Guercio, 49, a neighbor
walking by the Slepian home Saturday, ``we get a pumpkin smashed
around here, but that's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another neighbor, Neel Chary, said Slepian's four sons had told
him of a horrible scene. ``They just went into a panic,'' Chary
said. ``The oldest one called the grandpa and said, `Grandpa,
Grandpa, Dad's been shot.'''
