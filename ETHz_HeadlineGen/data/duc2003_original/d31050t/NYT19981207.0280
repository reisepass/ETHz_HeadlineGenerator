   BEIJING _ One leader of a suppressed new political party will be
tried on Dec. 17 on a charge of colluding with foreign enemies of
China ``to incite the subversion of state power,'' according to
court documents given to his wife on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to try the leader, Wang Youcai, a founder of the
China Democracy Party, with unusual speed suggests how serious the
Communist authorities are in their campaign to destroy the
fledgling party and silence dissidents who had begun to speak out
over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   The charges that Wang faces, in a trial that will almost
certainly be secret and quick, could bring a sentence of five years
or more. Wang, 32, has been imprisoned in his home city, Hangzhou
in eastern China, for a month, but was not formally arrested until
Nov. 30. On that day two prominent dissidents, both promoters of
the new party, were detained.
</P>
<P>
   One, Qin Yongmin, 45, of the central city of Wuhan, and the
other, Xu Wenli, 55, of Beijing, are being held on suspicion of
subversive activities. Detailed charges have not been filed.
</P>
<P>
   Wang was a student leader in the pro-democracy demonstrations in
Tiananmen Square in 1989. After the army had crushed the movement,
Wang was arrested and served two years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Qin and Xu became known as democracy advocates in the late
1970s. Qin was imprisoned for eight years. In 1993 he was put in a
labor camp for two years. Xu spent 12 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton visited in the spring, Wang announced the
formation of the Democracy Party. He and other dissidents hoped
that China's new friendship with the United States and its decision
to sign a global covenant on political and civil rights would give
them room to promote political alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton returned home Wang was detained, warned and
released, only to be re-arrested as authorities began what now
appears to be a major crackdown on dissent. Monday, Wang's wife, Hu
Jiangxia, was handed the bill of prosecution, according to the
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Wang is charged with helping draft a party manifesto that
states, in part, ``Only by establishing an opposition party can we
be rid of this despotism.'' That is cited as grounds for the
subversion charge, the information center said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to detailing Wang's organizing activities, the
prosecutors charge that he colluded with enemies of the state
abroad, making his crime far more serious under Chinese law.
</P>
<P>
   He used e-mail to send 18 copies of the party's founding
documents abroad, met with a member of a subversive foreign
organization and received money from foreign sources to buy a
computer, the indictment reportedly says.
