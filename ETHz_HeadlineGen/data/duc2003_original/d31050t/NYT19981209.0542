   NEW YORK _ A Chinese dissident fleeing a new round of arrests of
democracy activists in Shanghai arrived here Wednesday and
announced that he and other opponents of the Chinese government
plan a demonstration Thursday at the United Nations to protest the
crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   The dissident, Yao Zhenxian, who was released in April from a
Chinese labor camp, is a leader of the China Democracy Party, which
was formed in June during President Clinton's visit to China.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking through an interpreter at Kennedy International
Airport, Yao, 44, said little about why he had left Shanghai,
except that he and his younger brother, Yao Zhenxiang, 38, had been
sent to a labor camp in 1996 on a ``trumped-up charge'' of
publishing pornography.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Yao, who is also a prominent figure in the China
Democracy Party, is scheduled for release in April.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Chinese government arrested 10 members and
sympathizers of the China Democracy Party, one of whom, Wang
Youcai, is to go on trial Dec. 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese government feels it expanded too quickly,'' Yao
said at the airport, referring to his party. Washington gave Yao a
special visa, which expires in February.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wang Bingzhang, 50, an adviser to the overseas committee of
the party, said later that Yao had left China for personal and
political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were scared all the time,'' he said, referring to Yao's
wife, Yu Yingzhang, and daughter, Yao Yiting, 14, who accompanied
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family had a terrible life, especially the daughter.
Secret agents followed them all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The family trading business, which was 12 years old, was
shuttered by the government in 1996, said Wang, a former surgeon in
Beijing, ``so they had no way of living.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, after Yao made organizational trips to several
provinces, democracy activists urged him to go abroad, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted him to tell the truth about what is really
happening in China and to call on the whole world to pay
attention,'' Wang said.
</P>
<P>
   Beatrice Laroche, liaison at the United Nations for Human Rights
in China, a New York-based group, said the China Democracy Party
was a growing presence in some of China's most populous provinces,
including Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
   ``But their most vocal leaders have all recently been
detained,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Laroche said the Yao brothers, especially the younger man,
won prominence by helping to finance predecessors of the China
Democracy Party with money from the family business before it was
closed by the government.
