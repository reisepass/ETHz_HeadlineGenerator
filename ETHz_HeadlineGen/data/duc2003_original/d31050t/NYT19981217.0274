   BEIJING _ The separate trials of two prominent democracy
advocates for inciting subversion of the state opened Thursday
morning, with the families of both defendants protesting their
inability to hire defense lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The trial in the eastern city of Hangzhou of Wang Youcai, 32,
founder of the China Democracy Party, which is now suppressed, was
in session for just two hours and 10 minutes. It appears to be
finished, although the court did not announce a decision or say
when it would.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happens from here,'' said Wang's wife, Hu
Jiangxia, who was one of three relatives allowed to attend the
trial. ``I don't hold much hope,'' she added in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Wang, who spent two years in prison after the 1989 student
demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, was accused of organizing a
political party that sought to overturn Communist Party rule and of
colluding with foreign enemies of the state. He could face five
years or more in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Since all the lawyers his family approached were intimidated by
security agents, Ms. Hu said, Wang tried to mount his own defense
Thursday morning after prosecutors laid out their case. But the
judge frequently interrupted him and cut him off after half an
hour, saying he was not responding to the specific facts of the
case, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Wang argued that his activities were legal under China's
constitution and under an international covenant on political
rights that China has signed, Ms. Hu said.
</P>
<P>
   In the central city of Wuhan, the trial on similar charges of
Qin Yongmin, 45, a veteran dissident, also continued for something
over two hours. It will apparently be continued, said Qin's father,
Qin Qingguo, since the session ended after the prosecution
presented its charges.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, too, prospective lawyers had been intimidated or
detained, family members said. The elderly father's request to the
court Thursday morning for a postponement was ignored, so he and
one of the defendant's brothers stayed outside the court building
in protest, leaving another brother inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't feel there was any reason to observe the trial
because if Qin Yongmin did not have a defense attorney, then as far
as we were concerned the proceedings were meaningless,'' the father
said by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Embassy asked to observe the trials. When an embassy
official arrived at the court in Hangzhou Thursday morning, he was
told that there were no seats available and instead waited outside,
greeting Ms. Hu when she emerged, shaken, from the brief trial.
