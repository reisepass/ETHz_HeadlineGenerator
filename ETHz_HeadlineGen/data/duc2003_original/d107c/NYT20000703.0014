   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, July 3:
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Ryan says he never expected the national attention
he has received for declaring a moratorium on the death penalty in
Illinois. Ryan found himself in the media spotlight recently as a
counterexample to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who was presiding
over his 135th execution in five years. Ryan is by no one's
description a maverick. A pharmacist by training, he has spent
nearly 30 years in state politics, first as a member of the
Illinois Legislature, then as the Republican leader and speaker of
the House, then for two terms as lieutenant governor and two terms
as secretary of state, until he won election as governor in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he has single-handedly instigated a new national debate on
capital punishment by acting on conscience when faced with
statistical evidence that innocent people stand a very real chance
of being executed in Illinois. Since 1977, 13 inmates on death row
in that state have been exonerated compared with 12 executed. A
series in The Chicago Tribune found that of 260 capital cases that
had been appealed, fully half have been reversed for a new trial or
sentencing hearing. In more than 30 cases, the lawyers representing
death row inmates were disbarred or suspended. New research
nationwide has found that nearly 70 percent of capital cases that
were fully reviewed were found to have reversible errors.
</P>
<P>
   By being the first governor to impose a moratorium on
executions, Ryan has made it politically acceptable for
conservative Republicans and Democrats alike to rethink capital
punishment and how it is carried out. Many politicians have avoided
the issue for fear of being called soft on crime. The situation in
Illinois has caused even some prominent conservatives like the
evangelist Pat Robertson to question the fairness of this system.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan himself has long been a death penalty supporter. But given
the record of mistakes, he says, ``we have no choice but to try to
fix'' the system. He has appointed a commission to examine the
administration of the death penalty and to make recommendations for
change. He has set no deadline for the commission's work and
recently said that the moratorium would stand indefinitely unless
the commission could give him a ``100 percent guarantee'' that the
system could be made fair and just.
</P>
<P>
   That high standard calls into question the record of other death
penalty states. For death penalty supporters like Bush and Vice
President Al Gore, Ryan's cautious approach is a rebuke to their
own blindness to the system's mistakes. He has instructed the
nation on the only morally coherent position for supporters of
capital punishment to take, and that is that no execution can go
forward when there is abundant evidence that innocent people have
been put on death row.
</P>
<P>
   This page opposes the death penalty on a variety of
humanitarian, egalitarian, constitutional and moral principles. But
even those who do not share those principles ought to concede, as
Ryan has, that it is legally indefensible to execute a single
innocent person. That means, by our lights, that capital punishment
can never be acceptable as standard national practice for a
practical, legal reason as well as for the reasons of principle
listed above. For as Ryan has pointed out, our national experience
has shown that no system of investigations and trials can be so
perfect, so free of human error or flawed evidence or mistaken
identity as to guarantee that innocent people will not be executed.
