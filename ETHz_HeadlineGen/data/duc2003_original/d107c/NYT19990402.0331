<P>
   In their first statement in 19 years focusing exclusively on
opposing the death penalty, the nation's Roman Catholic bishops
issued a call Friday to ``all people of good will, and especially
Catholics,'' to work to end capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The statement _ timed to coincide with Good Friday observances
and also calling for compassion for crime victims _ reflects a
growing concern about capital punishment among the bishops, as well
as the continuing impact of Pope John Paul II's denunciation of the
death penalty during his pastoral visit to St. Louis in January.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Roger Mahony, archbishop of Los Angeles, said in a
telephone interview that the pope's words helped prompt the
statement, written by the bishops' 55-member Administrative Board,
which represents the National Conference of Catholic Bishops
between the group's twice-yearly meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we're trying to do is expose the myth that
we as a society gain something through the death penalty,'' said
the cardinal, who is chairman of the bishops' Committee on Domestic
Policy.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show a clear majority of Americans, and a majority of
Catholics among them, support the death penalty. But twice in the
last 14 months, calls by prominent religious figures to spare a
convict from execution have touched off wide debates over the uses
of capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1998, the conservative religious broadcaster Pat
Robertson, along with others, unsuccessfully urged Texas officials
to spare the life of Karla Faye Tucker, a murderer who had become a
born-again Christian in prison. But more dramatic was Pope John
Paul's successful appeal to Gov. Mel Carnahan of Missouri to show
mercy to Darrell J. Meese, a murderer who was to have been executed
two weeks after the pope's visit.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 28, the morning after the pope spoke to the governor at
an interfaith service in St. Louis, Carnahan, a Democrat who had
approved 26 previous executions, commuted Meese's sentence to life
without parole. The governor said the decision meant no change in
his support for capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   But the pope's actions inspired the bishops.
</P>
<P>
   In March, as Massachusetts legislators considered a bill to
allow capital punishment, Cardinal Bernard Law, the archbishop of
Boston, and the bishops of the state's three other dioceses issued
a toughly worded response that although murder must be punished,
the death penalty ``must be rejected as unworthy of us as a
civilized people.''
</P>
<P>
   As a national body, the bishops have opposed the death penalty
for three decades. In 1980 they said that while it would be
``morally unsatisfactory and socially destructive'' for criminals
not to be punished, the death penalty was unjustified.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's statement, the bishops said they were concerned
about the size of the nation's death row population and the
increasing pace of executions as condemned prisoners exhaust their
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout the states, more than 3,500 prisoners await their
deaths,'' the bishops wrote. ``These numbers are deeply troubling.
The pace of executions is numbing. The discovery of people on death
row who are innocent is frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   The bishops said they also hoped to persuade people that capital
punishment ``is often applied unfairly and in racially biased
ways.''

<P>
   Mahony said the statement represented a long-term recognition in
Catholic moral theology that society's ability to protect itself
from crime had become so effective, with modern prisons and life
sentences without parole, that capital punishment was unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   That view, he said, was made clear in Pope John Paul's
encyclical ``Evangelium Vitae'' in 1995, in which the Pontiff said
cases in which a government would need to apply the death penalty
were ``practically nonexistent.'' In St. Louis, the pope preached
that modern society ``has the means of protecting itself'' without
denying prison inmates a chance to reform.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the bishops, Mahony said, ``As disciples of Christ
and the Gospel, we have always said we have never overcome violence
by inflicting violence,'' adding, ``If you want any example, just
look at Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal said the bishops remained concerned about the
victims of crime. The statement urged Catholics to support the
families of crime victims ``as they struggle to overcome their
terrible loss and find some sense of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The bishops' statement drew praise from Jim Wallis, an
evangelical Protestant who is a central figure in Call to Renewal,
an antipoverty movement among urban evangelicals and Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Wallis, editor in chief of the religious magazine Sojourners,
said the statement would have an impact among moderate
evangelicals, some of whom, he added, have been re-thinking a broad
support for the death penalty since Ms. Tucker's execution.
