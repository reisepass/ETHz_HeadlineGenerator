	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Defying conventional wisdom, a new poll says
Californians are evenly divided between death and life without parole as the
proper punishment for first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
	   The survey, by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California,
contrasts with polls that have consistently shown support of about 3-1 for
capital punishment, both statewide and nationwide. Those polls have simply asked
respondents whether they favored or opposed the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   The Public Policy Institute poll asked whether they thought the penalty for
first-degree murder should be death or ``life imprisonment with absolutely no
possibility of parole.'' Those are the two choices for a jury in the penalty
phase of a capital case.
</P>
<P>
	   Forty-nine percent chose death, 47 percent chose life and the rest were
undecided. The poll, based on telephone interviews with 2,007 randomly chosen
Californians between Jan. 2 and Jan. 10, had a margin of error of plus or minus
2 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   When the same question was asked nationally by the Gallup Organization in
February, 56 percent favored the death penalty compared to 38 percent for life
without parole, said Mark Baldassare, the Public Policy Institute poll director.
</P>
<P>
	   He said a single poll is not enough to signal a statewide shift in public
opinion, but suggests at least that ``opinions are not as hard on this issue as
we might have thought they were.''
</P>
<P>
	   California has more than 550 people on death row and has executed seven
since resuming capital punishment in 1992 after a 25-year lapse.
