	Three innocent men freed from death row in Illinois. A mentally  
ill convict spared in Virginia. Questions of racial bias in 
Nebraska's justice system. 
</P>
<P>
	The death penalty is accepted and practiced more than ever in  
America, yet growing doubts about how it is applied have prompted a 
small movement of state lawmakers calling for a moratorium on 
executions to study whether the system is working fairly. 
</P>
<P>
	In at least 11 states this year, bills to halt or abolish  
capital punishment have been considered, and many have gone further 
than in the past. In addition, four states -- Michigan, Maine, 
Massachusetts and Iowa -- soundly rejected bills that would have 
established capital punishment. Thirty-eight states have adopted 
the death penalty, most recently New York (1995) and Kansas (1994). 
</P>
<P>
	``The trend over the past 20 years has been more states with the  
death penalty, more crimes eligible, more executions,'' said 
Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information 
Center, a Washington-based group critical of how capital punishment 
is applied. ``These are the first steps in the other direction. 
It's too early to tell whether this is a large trend away from the 
death penalty, but it's different than other years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legislative scrutiny, however, doesn't appear to represent  
weakening support for capital punishment. Seventy-one percent of 
Americans favored the death penalty in a February Gallup poll. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vast majority of Americans support the death penalty, and  
that support crosses all racial, religious and other conventional 
lines,'' said Paul Cassell, a University of Utah law professor who 
represented the families of some of the Oklahoma City bombing 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Several factors may be prompting lawmakers to re-examine capital  
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska's unicameral Legislature voted for a two-year stop to  
executions and some state leaders voiced concerns that Indian and 
black defendants are more likely to be sentenced to die than 
whites. The measure was vetoed by the governor Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Illinois, the House passed a non-binding resolution for a  
six-month moratorium amid fear an innocent man could die. The state 
exonerated convicted murderer Ronald Jones this month, the third 
person freed from Illinois' death row this year, and the 12th since 
1987. Several were freed after investigations by students at 
Northwestern University. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma and Louisiana have also freed inmates from death row  
this year after evidence emerged they were innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, crime is down nationwide, perhaps softening calls  
to get tough as a means of deterrence. And a strong appeal by Pope 
John Paul II to do away with the death sentence may have 
reverberated with religious conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea prompted Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan, a strong death  
penalty proponent, to commute the sentence of a convicted killer 
scheduled to die during the pope's January visit to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are beginning to look beyond the political speak of  
being tough on crime,'' said Walter H. White, Jr., chairman of the 
American Bar Association's section on individual rights and 
responsibilities. ``There is significant progress in the fact that 
people are debating the moratorium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ABA in 1997 called for a temporary halt to executions, and  
this year the United Nations followed with a proposal for a 
worldwide moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
	The pace of U.S. executions, however, is on the rise, pushed by  
laws passed earlier this decade that limit appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-six people have been put to death nationwide this year,  
and Texas and Louisiana each have an execution scheduled Tuesday. 
The country is on pace to top 100 executions this year for the 
first time since the Supreme Court ended a four-year nationwide ban 
on capital punishment in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn Lammi of the conservative Washington Legal Foundation said  
the moratorium movement does not represent a groundswell of 
opposition to capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it just exhibits that the small number of activists  
who have been pushing this argument have been successful in 
convincing people in power in some states to pursue it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, several death penalty supporters have recently  
voiced concerns about the use of capital punishment, at least in 
specific instances. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nebraska moratorium drive was led in part by state Sen.  
Kermit Brashear, a conservative supporter of the death penalty who 
said he wants to make sure the punishment is applied fairly. 
</P>
<P>
	In Virginia, Gov. Jim Gilmore commuted the death sentence of a  
mentally ill man earlier this month after not intervening in 21 
executions since he took office in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	And last year, Christian Coalition leader Pat Robertson lobbied  
against the execution in Texas of Karla Faye Tucker, a white 
born-again Christian woman convicted of a gruesome pickax-murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of the moratorium drive say they're surprised by the  
support generated in the two years since the ABA endorsed the 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the start of a movement that will look at a death  
penalty moratorium as a viable option,'' said Tony Banout, 
co-director of the Moratorium Now project at the liberal Quixote 
Center in Hyattsville, Md. ``We are just looking at the 
beginning.''
