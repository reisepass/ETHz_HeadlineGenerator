   SAN FRANCISCO _ For three days they met in San Francisco to help
one another learn to better swim against a powerful tide. Like the
rest of the nation, more than 70 percent of Californians support
the death penalty. But the swimmers _ 150 religious leaders from
around the state _ know the majority can be wrong. They believe
capital punishment threatens the very soul of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Capital punishment is an absolutely crazy idea,'' said Rabbi
Alan Lew of Congregation Beth Sholom in San Francisco. ``It's a
spiritual impossibility and a cruel hoax that is sold to the
families of victims. They are so vulnerable, the easiest thing to
sell them is anger. It's the biggest disservice we do to them. It
guarantees them a life of pain. The only possible healing comes
through forgiveness. The hard choice is the only one that works.''
</P>
<P>
   Lew met recently with other rabbis and with Catholic and
Episcopalian bishops, priests and nuns; ministers of several
Protestant and the Unitarian faiths and Buddhist, Muslim and Quaker
leaders. In ``Changing Hearts and Minds'' workshops and forums, the
group shared their ancient and sacred teachings against capital
punishment, heard from the families of murder victims and plotted
practical strategies for turning the tide against state-sanctioned
vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   The ``first-ever interfaith campaign against the death
penalty,'' the conference produced a Statement of Conscience, which
reads in part: ``We believe that the death penalty is morally
untenable, particularly when we have the means necessary to protect
ourselves from those who would kill.''
</P>
<P>
   The means referred to are ``life imprisonment without the
possibility of parole and restitution to the family of the
victim.''
</P>
<P>
   While most religions are based on a reverence for life, what now
prompts the formation of California People of Faith Working Against
the Death Penalty?
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the lopsided public opinion polls in favor of the
death penalty, group members point to pending state legislation
that would expand the number of crimes that are punishable by death
and clear the way for the execution of juveniles. Perhaps most
disturbing of all is the implementation of the 1996 federal
Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, which mandates a
much shorter time for the appeals process and could create by next
year a virtual ``execution mill'' that would rapidly kill some 200
of California's 512 death row inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``One hundred percent of death row inmates are impoverished _ if
you have enough money, you don't get the death penalty _ and about
one-third don't have any legal representation at all,'' said Lance
Lindsey of Death Penalty Focus of California. ``The one-year time
limit (for appeals) is going to have a backlash, and we will have
the prospect of living with routine and almost invisible
executions.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a prospect is intolerable for the women and men who
attended last week's conference. While the United States stands
alone among industrialized nations in its zeal for capital
punishment, and despite anti-death penalty pleas from the United
Nations and the American Bar Association, the bulk of the country's
politicians are in love with capital punishment. Thus, coalition
members are concentrating on a different arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen this issue politicized in recent years and
spiritual concerns pushed to the side,'' said Wilson Riles Jr., of
the Quaker-based American Friends Service Committee. ``Our campaign
will not be aimed at politicians, but at the people who elect
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides reacquainting many of those people with the basic tenets
of their professed faiths, coalition members want to raise public
awareness of how ``the language of rehabilitation is being lost''
in the American penal system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our God seeks to restore the human soul by redemption,'' said
Rebecca Parker, president of Starr King Unitarian Theological
School. ``Capital punishment does not accomplish justice, bring
closure, heal or end the cycle of violence. It is the product of a
passive, weak, reactionary justice system. And capital punishment
diminishes the soul of the person who seeks retribution.''
