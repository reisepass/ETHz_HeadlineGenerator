   WASHINGTON _ Their ranks are admittedly small, but their views
seem incompatible with their political philosophy. Still, in recent
weeks a number of prominent conservatives with tough law-and-order
credentials have raised questions about _ of all things _ the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them have pushed for more DNA testing to help acquit the
unjustly convicted. Others have called for more procedural
safeguards. Declaring that the death penalty discriminates against
members of minorities and poor people who cannot afford competent
lawyers, the televangelist Pat Robertson recently called for a
moratorium on executions. The columnist George Will wrote that
``skepticism is in order'' when it comes to capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   No one is predicting that a conservative rethinking of the death
penalty will spawn a political groundswell that will sweep away
capital punishment. But there are signs that they are scrambling
long-held notions about it. Recently, the Republican-controlled New
Hampshire state House of Representatives passed a bill to abolish
the death penalty, and the nonpartisan, but decidedly conservative,
Nebraska legislature approved a moratorium on executions.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming days Sen. Gordon H. Smith, R-Ore., will announce
that he is sponsoring a bill with Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., that
would provide competent lawyers for defendants in murder cases and
guarantee death row inmates access to DNA testing if that could
help exonerate them.
</P>
<P>
   And last January, Illinois Gov. George Ryan, a Republican, said
he was imposing a moratorium on executions after 13 people in his
state had been unjustly sentenced to death since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot support a system which, in its administration, has
proven so fraught with error and has come so close to the ultimate
nightmare, the state's taking of innocent life,'' he said, in
announcing the moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political climate is shifting,'' said Tim Lynch, director
of the Project on Criminal Justice for the Cato Institute, a
conservative-libertarian research and advocacy organization. ``I
think a lot of conservatives may not go as far as liberals and say
it should be abolished. But what happened in Illinois is getting
people to rethink whether sufficient safeguards are in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservative qualms about capital punishment are generally not
based on the alleged immorality of the death penalty; few
conservatives express a belief that executions are cruel and
unusual punishment and therefore unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the legitimacy of capital punishment is the
issue,'' said Bruce Fein, a conservative constitutional scholar.
``There are crimes that I feel are so heinous that there isn't
anything else that would represent sufficient societal
condemnation. But having said that, there is nothing that could be
more terrible to a system of justice than to send innocent people
to death. In that sense, I think the current system has flaws.''
</P>
<P>
   While some like Fein reject the idea of the death penalty as a
deterrent to crime, others like Will, argue that even if it is, its
misapplication should raise serious doubts.
</P>
<P>
   In an ironic political twist, some conservatives are proffering
an anti-government libertarian argument against capital punishment,
pushing a cause long favored by pro-government liberals.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you consider the foul-ups and mix-ups and incompetence
that you often find in government work, it gets scary,'' said
Lynch. ``You realize that the institution that puts people to death
is the same institution that delivers the mail to the wrong
people.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not that morality does not feature at all in the new
thinking. Some anti-abortion advocates draw little distinction
between killing a fetus and executing a person. ``It's a
consistency,'' Smith said, ``not an inconsistency, that people who
believe in the sanctity of life have an incentive to be sure that
the innocent are never put to death by state action, whether they
are unborn or in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, some conservatives say, a number of reasons for the
sudden change of heart on capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   With homicide tumbling to its lowest rate since 1967, there is
less fear and anger about crime, and as a result a general
softening by the public on the question of capital punishment. In a
recent Gallup Poll, 66 percent of respondents said they favored the
death penalty. Although high, the figure represents the lowest
level of support for executions in 19 years. Hence, conservatives _
and everybody else _ now have more political room to vent whatever
concerns they might have had about the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The use of DNA testing has also brought into sharp relief the
cases where defendants have been wrongly condemned to death, and
many conservatives have been shocked by stories of defense lawyers
falling asleep during murder trials.
</P>
<P>
   These new right-wing critics of capital punishment are a result
of a new smarter strategy by death penalty opponents, say some
death penalty experts and conservatives. Frustrated that moral and
abolitionist arguments were not getting them to first base with the
public, anti-capital punishment advocates stopped swinging for the
fences and lowered their sights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an attempt to appeal to the public's concerns,'' said
Richard Dieter, a longtime death penalty opponent who is now
executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. ``We
found out that they're not going to be opposed to the death penalty
just because a few people said they should. But they are concerned
about issues of fairness and innocence.''
