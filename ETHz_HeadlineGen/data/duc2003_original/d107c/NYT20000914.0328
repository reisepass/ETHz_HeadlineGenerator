   WASHINGTON _ Bolstered by findings that even Americans who favor
capital punishment worry that innocent people might be put to
death, several lawmakers vowed Thursday to renew their push for a
law to see that defendants in death-penalty cases have competent
lawyers and access to DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people are ahead of the politicians,'' said Sen. Patrick
Leahy of Vermont, the senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary
Committee and a sponsor of the Innocence Protection Act. ``They
know the death-penalty machinery is broken.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator referred to a survey taken in mid-August showing
that feelings among those who favor capital punishment are far from
monolithic. The survey found that 31 percent of the respondents
strongly supported the death penalty, 21 percent strongly opposed
it and 19 percent were not sure.
</P>
<P>
   But an additional 29 percent who support capital punishment also
acknowledged doubts and reservations about it. And among those who
said they were troubled, nearly three times as many were more
worried about an innocent person being executed than about a guilty
person evading execution.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 802 registered voters was conducted jointly by
Peter Hart Research, a Democratic research firm, and American
Viewpoint, a Republican firm. It had a sampling error of 3
percentage points and was done for the Justice Project, a national
organization that focuses on criminal-justice issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Innocence Protection Act is a carrot-and-stick package
intended to assure that states make DNA testing available for
capital defendants and provide more federal money to assure
competent legal representation. It was introduced in both houses
last winter but has not gained traction.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy and another sponsor, Rep. Bill Delahunt, D-Mass., said
that good defense counsel was even more important than DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The availability of DNA testing has really shown the
inadequacy of counsel,'' Delahunt said.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy and Delahunt are former prosecutors who oppose capital
punishment. Two other sponsors, Rep. Ray LaHood of Illinois and
Sen. Gordon H. Smith of Oregon, both Republicans, favor it in
principle.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reservations are removed if this bill is passed,'' Smith
said. ``Let's have one standard of justice when it comes to the
ultimate remedy.''
