   UNDATED SIDEBAR TO CAPITAL-PUNISHNENT
</P>
<P>
   Last week's postponement of Mose Young's execution slowed, but
did not stop, Missouri's march to near the top of states with the
highest numbers of executions.
</P>
<P>
   Since it reinstated the death penalty in 1989, Missouri has
executed 43 inmates by lethal injection _ fourth among states using
capital punishment, according to figures from the Death Penalty
Information Center as of Thursday. Texas leads the nation with 224
executions since it reinstated the death penalty in 1982; Virginia,
which also reinstated capital punishment in 1982, is a distant
second with 77. Florida is third with 48; it reinstated the death
penalty in 1979.

<P>
   Missouri executed one inmate in 1989, four in 1990 and one each
in 1991 and 1992. In 1993, the state executed four inmates. After a
one-year break with no executions in 1994, six inmates were put to
death in each of the next three years. That slowed to three in
1998, then jumped again to nine last year. This year, two inmates
have been executed.
