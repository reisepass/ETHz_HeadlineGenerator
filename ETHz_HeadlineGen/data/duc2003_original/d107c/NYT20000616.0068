   ``Bush Defends Streamlined Texas Death Penalty System,'' shouted
the front page of Wednesday's Los Angeles Times. According to the
article, ``Serious debate about how the death penalty is
administered in America has begun to percolate for the first time
in years _ a newly nuanced discussion that is spilling over into
Campaign 2000 and will likely dog Bush's campaign from now until
election day.''
</P>
<P>
   Dog? Spill? Percolate? These are the telltale verbs of a
self-concealing journalist. Once again, the media are driving a
story to embarrass George W. Bush _ and using the pretense of
objectivity to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's media-driven controversy was whether Bush had used
cocaine. Reporters kept saying the cocaine question was ``dogging''
Bush, as though the question had a life of its own.
</P>
<P>
   But questions don't dog politicians, reporters do. That maxim
bears repeating amid the current frenzy over Bush's use of capital
punishment. Debates don't dog politicians, much less percolate or
spill onto them. Journalists help decide when to brew those debates
and where to pour them.
</P>
<P>
   The press is well out of step with public opinion on the death
penalty. Reporters claim that ``America'' is ``rethinking'' the
issue. But while elite journalists overwhelmingly oppose the death
penalty, polls show that two-thirds of Americans still support it.
</P>
<P>
   And while the public's concerns are largely confined to whether
some people on death row might be innocent, most journalists oppose
capital punishment anyway, either in principle or because they
believe its application is racially discriminatory. They think it's
outrageous that Texas, under Bush, has executed more than 130
convicted murderers.
</P>
<P>
   They want to embarrass Bush and halt capital punishment by
exposing flaws in the Texas system.
</P>
<P>
   For months, out-of-state reporters have scoured Texas for
evidence of dubious murder convictions. Newspapers and
newsmagazines have churned out article after article to keep the
story going.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month, The New York Times has published a dozen
major stories on the death penalty and the Texas system. The
Chicago Tribune issued a press release promoting its front-page
investigation (headline: ``Flawed Trials Lead to Death Chamber;
Bush Confident in System Rife With Problems''). The Los Angeles
Times sent a reporter to New Orleans to cover a federal appeals
court hearing on a screwy Texas case.
</P>
<P>
   When appellate courts find errors committed by trial courts, the
press cries scandal. When appellate courts don't find errors
committed by trial courts, the press cries scandal again. Look at
the June 12 Tribune. While the article on Page 7 protests that
two-thirds of the nation's death penalty cases ``were thrown out by
higher courts or sent back for reconsideration,'' the article on
the front page (''Justices Prove Reluctant to Nullify Cases'')
protests that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals often fails to
``acknowledge holes in the prosecution's case.''
</P>
<P>
   To obscure their zeal, journalists invoke the passive voice.
``New questions are being raised about capital punishment,'' says a
CNN report. ``Texas Lawyer's Death Row Record a Concern,'' adds the
New York Times. Whose questions? Whose concerns? Not the
reporter's.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Bush is the GOP's presumptive presidential nominee, the
case of death row prisoner Ricky McGinn ``has begun to take on
political significance,'' says The New York Times. Not that any
editor assigned the case such significance, mind you. The case
simply ``took it on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times of London agrees that McGinn ``brought the death
penalty issue into the presidential campaign.'' How McGinn
performed this delivery from his prison cell remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Every newspaper assault on Bush includes the obligatory
``scrutiny'' paragraph. The lines hardly vary. ``Texas' death
penalty system has come under increased scrutiny since Bush
announced his presidential candidacy,'' says the Tribune. ``Texas's
vigorous death penalty system is under close scrutiny because of
Bush's presidential campaign,'' says The Washington Post. ``With
Mr. Bush as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee,
capital punishment in Texas is under heightened scrutiny,'' says
The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Who's heightening all this scrutiny? The cases themselves are
doing it. The upcoming execution of inmate Gary Graham ``is the
latest high-profile death penalty case to focus attention on Gov.
George W. Bush and how the death penalty is administered in his
state,'' says the Times.
</P>
<P>
   The issue doesn't just hound Bush (He's ``been dogged by his
remarks about Karla Faye Tucker, a Texas inmate executed early last
year,'' according to The Philadelphia Inquirer). It creeps up on
him (he gave McGinn a reprieve ``against a backdrop of creeping
unease over capital punishment,'' says Time) and occasionally
attacks him ('' '81 Death Penalty Case Confronts Bush,'' says the
Post).
</P>
<P>
   It has even arrested him. ``The Death Penalty on Trial,''
announces Newsweek's June 12 cover story. ``The death penalty is in
the dock,'' and ``capital punishment in Texas is in the cross hairs
this political season.''
</P>
<P>
   Whose cross hairs? Whose courtroom? Newsweek doesn't say.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, Bush brought all this on himself. First he ran for
president. ``Bush Candidacy Puts Focus on Executions,'' reported
The New York Times. Then he hinted at a reprieve for McGinn. ``Talk
of Reprieve -- Brings Death Penalty Issue to Campaign Fore,''
responded The Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   Then he went through with the reprieve, prompting CBS anchor Bob
Schieffer to conclude that Bush had ``rekindled the debate on the
death penalty'' and had ``put the focus on this whole idea of DNA
testing and whether people on death row have been correctly
defended.'' Bush, not the fourth estate, kept the fire going and
the issue in focus.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Texas criminal justice system is riddled with flaws.
Yes, there's an uncomfortably high probability that it has executed
an innocent person. But there's an even greater probability that it
has failed to bring hundreds of real killers to justice. The same
is true of other states.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is, journalists aren't writing those stories.
We're writing this one. That's our decision. And we ought to admit
it.
