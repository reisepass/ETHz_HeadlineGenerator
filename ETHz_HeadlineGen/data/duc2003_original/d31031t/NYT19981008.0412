   WASHINGTON _ Republican congressional leaders presented the
Clinton administration Thursday with a list of lending conditions
that they want imposed on the International Monetary Fund in order
for Congress to approve $18 billion in new money for the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   Administration and congressional officials said they were
hopeful that they could soon agree on compromise legislation to
provide the money to the IMF to refill reserve accounts depleted by
the fund's attempts to bail out the economies of Russia and three
Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
   But they said they were still without a timetable for an
agreement. Citing the turmoil in international financial markets,
the White House has insisted that the legislation be approved and
sent to the president before Congress adjourns for the year, which
could happen this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   While the list of conditions being sought by the Republicans was
not made public, congressional officials said it included a demand
that the IMF open its books for public scrutiny, that it end the
practice of lending to foreign governments at below-market interest
rates, and that it shorten the lending period on most loans.
</P>
<P>
   The list was presented to Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin during
a meeting Thursday on Capitol Hill with the Senate majority leader,
Trent Lott, R-Miss., and House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Rubin told reporters that it had gone well.
``It was a good meeting,'' he said. ``It was very constructive and
we're just going to keep working forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say the White House is reluctant to
accept any legislation that imposes onerous lending conditions on
the IMF, especially at a time when the fund needs flexibility to
avert a global financial meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has already approved the full $18 billion in new fund
financing requested by the Clinton administration. But the House
has balked at the request and has so far approved only $3.4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The talks this week are aimed at satisfying House Republican
leaders, who are being pressed by conservatives within their party
who have questioned whether the economic crisis that has swept the
third world is evidence that the monetary fund has outlived its
usefulness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been as critical about the IMF as many, but given the
crisis we have around the world, the U.S. needs to provide
leadership,'' said Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, a key Republican in
the talks.
</P>
<P>
   He said that given the chaos in international financial markets,
the United States was left with no option but to provide the money
to the fund. ``The only real avenue is the IMF,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional officials say the House leadership has shown a new
willingness to resolve the monetary fund issue _ and to end a
variety of other financing disputes with the White House _ in hopes
of preventing a government shutdown that might distract public
attention away from the impeachment investigation of President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, if the United States fails to provide the money other
nations might reduce their contributions, leaving the fund short of
the $90 billion it says is needed to deal with the current world
financial crisis.
