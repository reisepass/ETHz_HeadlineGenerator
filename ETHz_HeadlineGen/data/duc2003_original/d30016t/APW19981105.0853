	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Temperatures rose to 300 degrees (570
degrees F) without leaving traces of fire in the front part of
Swissair Flight 111 before it crashed, an in-house publication of
the airline said Thursday.
	   There still is no indication of the source of the heat, said the
publication, ``News.'' It described as ``pure speculation''
theories that a fire was caused by an electrical short that ignited
insulation material.
	   The MD-11 airliner flying from New York to Geneva crashed Sept.
2 off the coast of Canada, killing all 229 people aboard. The crew
reported smoke in the cockpit 16 minutes before the crash.
	   Investigators, who have found that high heat melted plastic in
the first 40 feet (12 meters) of the plane, were surprised that the
heat was in the upper part of the plane and not below the cockpit
floor, where most of the wiring is located, the newsletter said.
	   Previous reports have said the temperature was high enough to
damage plastic, but the newsletter gave the first indication of
just how hot it was.
	   The newsletter, published for the staff by the airline's parent
SAirGroup, said the findings by Canadian investigators were
disclosed by Hans Ulrich Beyeler, Swissair head of technology, in a
speech to the Technical Society of Zurich.
	   Last week, the airline announced it was switching off a
state-of-the-art entertainment system on its remaining 15 MD-11s
and three Boeing 747s as a precautionary measure.
	   Swissair said the video-on-demand system for first and business
class was being disconnected from a power supply network routed
through the cockpit because it was nonessential and because that is
the area where the investigation is concentrated.
	   The newsletter said 90 percent of the wreckage has been
recovered.
