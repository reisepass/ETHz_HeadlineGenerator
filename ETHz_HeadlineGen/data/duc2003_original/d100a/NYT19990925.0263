   A Massachusetts scientist who helped dispel the once widely held
belief that schizophrenia came from bad mothering has won an Albert
Lasker Award, widely regarded as America's Nobel Prize, for his
lifetime achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Seymour S. Kety, 84, a neuroscientist at McLean Hospital and
Harvard, is being recognized for helping to provide a biological
basis for understanding mental illness and for research on cerebral
blood flow that laid the groundwork for today's sophisticated brain
imaging.
</P>
<P>
   Kety, of Westwood, Mass., recalled in an interview that when he
became the first scientific director of the National Institute of
Mental Health in 1951, schizophrenia was primarily considered a
result of poor parenting, particularly by mothers, a notion, he
said, that ``left me cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Kety said he felt ``it was foolhardy . . . to not study the
brain in connection with mental illness, because we didn't know
enough about the brain.'' He structured the research he directed so
that basic scientific questions could be asked.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Kety began a landmark study of Danish adoptees
with schizophrenia that showed the importance of genetics in the
development of the disease and helped dispel the notion of the
``schizophrenogenic mother.'' He continues to pursue this research.
</P>
<P>
   Kety is one of six US scientists being recognized this year with
a Lasker Award, which will be presented in New York City Friday and
comes with a $25,000 honorarium.
</P>
<P>
   The award for basic medical research goes to Clay M. Armstrong,
Bertil Hille, and Roderick MacKinnon, who examined cells' ion
channels, critical for understanding everything from nerve impulses
to muscle contractions.
</P>
<P>
   The award for clinical medical research is being shared by David
W. Cushman and Miguel A. Ondetti, for developing drugs called ACE
inhibitors, which are used to treat high blood pressure, heart
failure, and diabetic kidney disease.
</P>
<P>
   Of the more than 300 scientists who have won a Lasker Award
since its creation in 1946 by philanthropists Albert and Mary
Woodard Lasker, 61 have also received Nobel Prizes.
</P>
<P>
   In honoring Kety, the Lasker Award citation said he, ``more than
any single person, brought important scientific perspective . . .
through a series of landmark studies of the biological and adoptive
families of schizophrenic adoptees.''
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers familiar with Kety's work agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really deserves a lot of credit,'' said Dr. Donald Goff,
director of the psychotic disorders program at Massachusetts
General Hospital, where Kety once worked. While he does not know
Kety personally, Goff said, Kety's research is famous in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Kety, senior psychobiologist at McLean Hospital in Belmont and
professor emeritus of neuroscience at Harvard Medical School, also
developed the concept of chelation to remove lead chemically from
the blood in cases of lead poisoning.
