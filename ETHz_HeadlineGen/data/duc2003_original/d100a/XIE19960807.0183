TIANJIN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- People's palms and fingerprints
may be used to diagnose schizophrenia and other mental disorders,
a group of Chinese psychiatrists announced.
</P>
<P>
The occurrence of wrinkles and creases in the palm, and ridge
dissociation in the finger and palm were much higher among
schizophrenic patients than in mentally-healthy adults, according
to psychiatrist Feng Zhiying, the head of the research group.
</P>
<P>
Since 1927, psychiatrists have been reading palms and
fingerprints to diagnose mental disease. Some believe that because
the human nervous system and skin develop together, any
abnormality of the nervous system should appear on the skin.
</P>
<P>
Feng and his colleagues, who work at Anding Hospital of
Tianjin, chose palm creases and ridge dissociation, or uneven skin
texture, in fingerprints and palms as criteria for the diagnosis
of schizophrenia. They have launched a decade-long research study
of 275 schizophrenics, using 275 non-schizophrenics as a control
group.
</P>
<P>
Feng said there is an especially high number of creases on
the palm of a person with schizophrenia, and that the wrinkles are
in disordered patterns.
</P>
<P>
Results showed that the high rate of palm creases was 11.7
percent in male and 40.4 percent in female schizophrenics, while
the control group showed only 2.3 percent of the men and 4.8
percent of the women had the tendency.
</P>
<P>
The occurrence of ridge dissociation was 12.6 percent and 3.5
percent in fingerprints and palms of male and female
schizophrenics, respectively, compared with 2 percent and 0.3
percent in the control subjects.
</P>
<P>
"These parameters may provide an important clue in the
discovery of an auxiliary diagnostic index for schizophrenia,"
Feng said.
</P>
<P>
Feng said a 50-year-old man had been mis-diagnosed as a
schizophrenic, but Feng decided that the patient suffered
from a mental disorder brought on by improper deep-breathing
exercises.
</P>
<P>
The patient's palm and fingerprints appeared normal, Feng said,
and the man was cured later after taking medication.
