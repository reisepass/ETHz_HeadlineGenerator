   A family history of schizophrenia remains the best predictor of
whether a person will develop the illness, but environmental
influences like place and season of birth are also significant risk
factors, according to the findings of a large epidemiological study
by Danish researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in Thursday's issue of The New England
Journal of Medicine, found that having a parent or a sibling with
schizophrenia increased a person's chances of developing the
illness by about sevenfold to ninefold. But people who are born in
the winter months, in particular in February or March, or who are
born in urban areas, are also slightly more likely to develop
schizophrenia than people born at other times of the year or in
rural regions.
</P>
<P>
   People born in Copenhagen, Denmark's capital, were 2.4 times as
likely to develop schizophrenia as those born in rural areas, the
study found. February and March were the months of birth associated
with the highest risk, while August and September were the months
associated with the lowest risk.
</P>
<P>
   But the risk to the individual represented by time and place of
birth is still very small, said Dr. Preben Bo Mortensen, the lead
author of the study, who is a psychiatric epidemiologist at the
Institute for Basic Psychiatric Research at Arhus University
Hospital in Riskow. ``One shouldn't panic if one is born in
March,'' Mortensen said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 1.75 million subjects in the study, all of whom were
children of Danish women born from 1935 to 1978, 2,669 had received
a diagnosis of schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   The findings add weight to previous studies over several decades
showing a link between schizophrenia and season or place of birth.
Because the months of highest risk correspond to the flu season,
scientists suspect that a viral infection during pregnancy may
affect the development of a fetus. Living in densely populated
areas also puts people at higher risk of contracting viral
diseases.

   ``It's reasonable that any number of insults or `hits' that
impact the system might impair the normal migration of nerve cells
to their proper place and their proper connections,'' said Dr.
David Shore, associate director of clinical research at the
National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial accompanying the journal article, Dr. Nancy
Andreasen, who holds the Andrew H. Woods Chair of Psychiatry at the
University of Iowa College of Medicine, wrote that pinpointing the
causes of schizophrenia was ``clearly a complicated matter.'' The
disease runs in families, she said, and studies of identical twins
and children raised by adoptive parents show that genetic factors
play a role .
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Andreasen noted, ``Since schizophrenia persists as an
illness despite the fact that the majority of its victims do not
marry or procreate, and since it appears to have the same lifetime
prevalence throughout the world, it seems likely that multiple,
different, nonspecific, nongenetic factors that affect
neurodevelopment are implicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Schizophrenia afflicts about 1 percent of Americans, or about
2.7 million people.
</P>
<P>
   The Danish study is the largest epidemiological study to examine
multiple risk factors in schizophrenia. The researchers took
advantage of the Danish Civil Registration System, in which every
Danish resident is assigned at birth a personal identification
number. Data from the birth registry were then correlated with
cases of schizophrenia identified through the Danish Psychiatric
Central Register, which keeps track of all admissions to
psychiatric hospitals. Psychiatric treatment in Denmark is free,
and there are no private psychiatric hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers concluded that while family history of
schizophrenia represented the highest relative risk for an
individual, place and season of birth accounted for more cases of
schizophrenia for the population as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Mortensen compared the relative risks of family history and
place of birth in schizophrenia to the role of asbestos exposure
and smoking as risk factors for lung cancer. A person exposed to
asbestos runs a relatively high risk of developing lung cancer, but
asbestos exposure is uncommon, Mortensen said. For the population
at large, smoking represents a larger risk factor.
</P>
<P>
   But Mortensen and other scientists pointed out that the Danish
study might underestimate the influence of genetic factors, since
some people might carry genes for the illness without showing
symptoms of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many individuals have genetic susceptibilities to
schizophrenia, even though they don't have affected parents and
siblings,'' said Dr. Kenneth Kendler, a professor in the department
of psychiatry and human genetics at the Medical College of Virginia
at Virginia Commonwealth University.
</P>
<P>
   Mortensen and his colleagues found that the chances of
developing schizophrenia were also slightly elevated for children
born to Danish mothers who had emigrated to other countries. One
possible explanation is that the mothers were exposed to new
infectious agents in their adopted countries.
</P>
<P>
   That appeared to be the case in an earlier study, which found an
increased risk for schizophrenia among second-generation black
Caribbean immigrants living in London.
