<P>
   The sense of smell, as Marcel Proust and his madeleine made
clear, is intimately tied to feeling and memory.
</P>
<P>
   So it is perhaps not surprising that in schizophrenia, an
illness that plays havoc with the emotional capacities of those who
suffer from it, the sense of smell is impaired.
</P>
<P>
   People with schizophrenia often display what psychiatrists
describe as a ``blunting'' of emotional response that makes it
difficult for them to relate to others. But they also, researchers
have found, show deficits in their ability to detect, identify and
remember odors.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new study, appearing in this month's American Journal of
Psychiatry, suggests that these abnormalities in the sense of smell
have their root in abnormal brain structure.
</P>
<P>
   Using magnetic resonance imaging, Dr. Bruce Turetsky, an
associate professor of psychiatry at the University of
Pennsylvania, and his colleagues examined the olfactory bulbs _
blueberry-sized organs that act as relay stations between the nose
and brain _ in 26 schizophrenic patients and 22 comparison
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The bulbs of patients with schizophrenia, the researchers found,
were on average 23 percent smaller in volume than those of control
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The discrepancy in size, said Turetsky, was large enough that it
was clearly visible on the MRI scans. The difference between the
groups persisted even after cigarette smoking, the use of
anti-psychotic medications, age and other factors that might
influence the size of the bulbs were taken into account.
</P>
<P>
   The study, said Dr. Robert Bilder, associate director for human
research at the Center for Advanced Brain Imaging of the Nathan
Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research in Orangeburg, N.Y., is,
he believes, the first to reveal, in schizophrenia, a structural
abnormality in more primitive brain areas, which are also involved
in emotional processing.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last 10 or 20 years,'' Bilder said, schizophrenia
researchers have paid ``an enormous amount of attention to the
higher parts of the brain and the associated higher cognitive
functions. This kind of a study is important in moving the focus to
lower brain systems, that are crucial to the regulation of emotion
and visceral functions.''
</P>
<P>
   Further investigation of the relationship between olfaction and
schizophrenia, Turetsky said, may also help shed light on the
emotional disturbances that are characteristic of the illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smell is so tightly linked to emotional processing,'' Turetsky
said. ``It's essentially impossible to present an olfactory
stimulus that doesn't have an emotional valence to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The olfactory system offers scientists a unique window on both
normal and abnormal brain functioning, in part because it is so
clearly laid out, with sensory impulses traveling from receptors in
the nose to the olfactory bulbs, where they are decoded, and then
to olfactory centers in higher brain regions.
</P>
<P>
   The changes in olfaction observed in schizophrenia, researchers
believe, may also contain clues to how the disease develops. Many
scientists suspect that schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental
disorder, a result of hereditary predisposition and some
environmental insult, perhaps occurring during the early months of
fetal growth.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the smaller size of the olfactory bulbs in schizophrenia
reflects abnormalities occurring early in development or stems from
a degenerative process later in life is still unknown, Turetsky
said. But, he pointed out, olfactory neurons, unlike those in other
areas of the brain, die and are replaced throughout life,
displaying a plasticity that makes the olfactory system relatively
resistant to degenerative disease.
</P>
<P>
   A loss of smell or abnormalities in odor identification or
detection is also seen in some degenerative diseases, like
Alzheimer's. The next task facing the researchers, said Dr. John Q.
Trojanowski, a professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at
Penn, is to show that the smaller volume of the olfactory bulbs is
specific to schizophrenia and is not found in other illnesses, like
manic depression, alcoholism or dementia.
</P>
<P>
   Although scientists have been studying the brains of patients
with schizophrenia for a century or more, no one appears to have
ever noticed a difference in the size of the olfactory bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   One reason, Trojanowski said, may be that early researchers saw
no particular reason to pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at how the bulbs sit in the skull when you take
out the brain, it's easy to leave them behind,'' Trojanowski said.
