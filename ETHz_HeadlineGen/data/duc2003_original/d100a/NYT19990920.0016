   Schizophrenia, the devastating mental illness that afflicts an
estimated 2.7 million Americans, is rarely diagnosed until it
becomes full-blown. But a new study suggests that young men who
will develop the disease may be identifiable even before any
symptoms appear.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, some mental health experts say, lend support to
the idea that doctors will eventually be able to offer preventive
treatment to people who are judged to be at high risk for
schizophrenia but have not yet fallen ill.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, the researchers, led by Dr. Michael Davidson,
professor of psychiatry at Tel Aviv University, took advantage of
the Israeli Draft Board Registry, which archives the results of
compulsory screening of Israeli adolescents aged 16 and 17. The
teen-agers take tests measuring their intellectual, medical and
psychiatric fitness for military service.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the screening, the adolescents were asked about their
personal relationships, their general level of maturity and
autonomy, and their ability to organize their lives. The questions
included: How many good friends do you have? How often are you late
for school? Who cleans your room? Do you tend to be the center of
attention at parties?
</P>
<P>
   Young men who were deemed healthy by the draft board but were
later hospitalized for schizophrenia, the researchers found, had
shown subtle abnormalities in intellectual and social functioning
on the screening tests. Their scores on all the measures included
in the study were significantly lower than those of a comparable
group of teen-agers who did not fall ill.
</P>
<P>
   Using the test scores, Davidson and his colleagues were able to
classify 87.5 percent of the adolescents correctly according to
whether they would become ill. The study appears in this month's
issue of The American Journal of Psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson said in an interview that while more research needed to
be done, his study and others documenting early warning signs of
schizophrenia were raising ``major issues'' about how early
treatment should begin.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Yale University and in Australia are already
using antipsychotic drugs experimentally to treat subjects who are
at high risk for schizophrenia and display early signs of the
illness, though they do not have definitive symptoms. But though a
new generation of drugs for psychosis have fewer side effects than
older medications, the treatments are not without risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe five years from now we'll have drugs with even fewer
adverse effects,'' Davidson said. ``The issue is that if my
findings and other people's findings are true, at a certain point
we have to begin treating people who have very mild symptoms. In a
way, it's like finding a gene _ do you treat asymptomatic people
who have a gene for breast cancer?''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kenneth Davis, chairman of psychiatry at Mount Sinai
Hospital in New York City, said the study offered the possibility
``that we might really be able to identify people with a high risk
and be able to do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said studies showed that the longer a first episode of
schizophrenia went untreated, the poorer patients did in the long
run. ``You don't want to label people inappropriately,'' he said.
But providing ``aggressive and effective treatment may result in a
better long-term course.''
