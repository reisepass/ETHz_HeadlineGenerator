   Cesarean babies may be more susceptible to schizophrenia than
children born naturally, say Canadian researchers who studied the
effects of the operation on rats. The finding raises doubts about
the increasing number of Cesarean sections performed for
convenience.

   Patricia Boksa and Bassem El-Khodor of McGill University in
Montreal gave pregnant rats general anesthetics and delivered their
young by Cesarean section. The operations were uncomplicated, and
the rat pups appeared normal at birth. But they grew into adults
with marked differences compared with controls born naturally.

   ``To our surprise, we kept finding dopamine system
differences,'' Boksa says. When the Cesarean rats were given
amphetamines, for instance, drugs that activate the dopamine system
in the brain, they became far more active than the other group, the
researchers told last week's meeting. The Cesarean rats also had a
far worse response to repeated tail pinching, a standard test for
stress reactions.

   The results hint that babies born by Cesarean may be more
vulnerable to schizophrenia, which is thought to involve an
overactive dopamine system and has a statistical link with birth
complications.

   But no one knows why a Cesarean birth might increase the risk of
developing the illness. Boksa thinks the absence of hormonal surges
when a baby is born naturally may play a role, because these may be
important for brain development. Boksa says we need more evidence
about the operation's effects. ``I would question the Cesarean
section of convenience,'' she says.

   ``There's a lot of discussion about complications precipitating
schizophrenia in genetically vulnerable people,'' says Barbara Fish
of the University of California at Los Angeles, who studies the
effects of difficult births. But she cautions that it is difficult
to draw conclusions from the studies when many environmental
factors are involved. &QL;
