PARIS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today promised the Czech Republic that France will do all it can
to help Prague join the European Union (EU) in 2000 and the NATO
in 1999, according to Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the two chambers of the Czech parliament in
Prague today, Chirac said, "Prepare ourselves without delay,
prepare ourselves together."
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held later today, Chirac said, "Europe
cannot exist in the future if it is not united."
</P>
<P>
"The split of Yalta has done us a lot of pain, and it should be
definitely erased," said Chirac, referring to the division of
Europe in two blocs after World War II.
</P>
<P>
He said that the NATO Madrid summit to be held in July will
discuss how to "renew the alliance to adapt it to the present
imperatives of European security and to reaffirm within itself a
European identity of defense, in which the Czech Republic should
fully play its role."
</P>
<P>
"The Czech Republic should be one of those countries which will
join NATO in 1999," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Calling for a "constructive cooperation" between NATO and
Russia, Chirac said that it is necessary to establish a charter
between the two sides so that Moscow will not think that NATO's
expansion makes up "an aggression or humiliation" for it.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Hungary, Poland and Romania should also be
the countries to join NATO in the first wave.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between NATO and central European countries
applying for its membership will begin in January 1998.
