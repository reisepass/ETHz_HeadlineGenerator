OTTAWA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien said today that he supports the Czech Republic's bid to
join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Canada also supports NATO membership applications by the other
five members of the now defunct Warsaw Pact, Chretien said while
accompanying Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus to the Canadian
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The other five countries bidding for NATO membership are
Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania and Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
"For me, I would be in favor of the six countries but I don't
think there will be six, even if it were my wish," Chretien
said. "But I know the Czech Republic is always at the top of the
list."
</P>
<P>
Canada and the United States support NATO's eastward expansion
plans, but Russia strongly opposes the move.
</P>
<P>
Klaus, leading a delegation of business people, arrived in
Ottawa today for a three-day visit aimed mainly at expanding trade
and investment between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
So far, Canada has invested about 110 million U.S. dollars in
the Czech Republic. Bilateral trade reached some 118 million
dollars in 1996, up from 102 million the previous year.
