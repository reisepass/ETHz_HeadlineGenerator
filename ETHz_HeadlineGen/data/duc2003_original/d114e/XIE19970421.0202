PRAGUE, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin arrived here today for a three-day visit to discuss
NATO's eastward expansion with Czech leaders.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin, the first Russian prime minister to visit the
country since the former Czechoslovakia split in 1993, will meet
his Czech counterpart, Vaclav Klaus, and Czech parliament leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic is one the countries most likely to be
admitted into NATO during the military alliance's summit in July.
</P>
<P>
Russia strongly opposes the planned NATO eastward enlargement,
fearing it would bring nuclear and other weapons to its border. It
has demanded a binding treaty with NATO on a new Russian-NATO
relationship.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his departure, Chernomyrdin said that Moscow was
enhancing ties with the Czechs in many areas, with economic
cooperation as the priority, media reports said.
</P>
<P>
However, a Czech official remarked several days ago that the
Czech Republic would use the visit to tell Russia about its
position and interests in becoming a full NATO member.
</P>
<P>
Moscow is also concerned about a Czech decision last week to
buy 53 billion cubic meters of Norwegian natural gas over the next
20 years, since its Gazprom has been Czech's sole gas supplier.
