   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- With heavy rains forecast and
Mozambique's main highways still impassable, the British navy
anchored a floating helipad at the mouth of the swollen Save River
on Thursday to speed food aid to flood victims.
</P>
<P>
   From deck of the ship Ft. George, five British helicopters will
deliver food to 45,000 hungry flood victims near the central town
of Machanga, said Lindsey Davies, a spokeswoman for the World Food
Program, a U.N. agency.
</P>
<P>
   With heavy rains forecast in central and northern Mozambique
during the next five days, international aid agencies were
scrambling for different ways to rush food to flood survivors, but
their reliance on aircraft had not diminished.
</P>
<P>
   ''The unpredictable weather that's hampering our road access
will continue to make helicopters a vital source of aid for those
who need it,'' Davies said. She said there were renewed fears of
flooding because the Zambezi and Buzi rivers in central Mozambique
were reaching a ''critical level.''
</P>
<P>
   Monthlong flooding in central and southern Mozambique has killed
at least 492 people, left 330,000 homeless and caused an estimated
$250 million in damage to roads, bridges, railways and buildings.
</P>
<P>
   After a ruinous civil war that ended in 1992, Mozambique's
economy had been recovering when the floods struck. Its growth
rate, roughly 10 percent a year, is expected to fall this year
because of the disaster. The country remains one of the poorest in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a huge reconstruction bill, Mozambique's government
expressed disappointment Thursday that some creditor nations agreed
to suspend -- but not cancel -- its foreign debts, which it said
stand at $1.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Paris Club of Western creditors had announced a day earlier
that because of the extensive flooding, Mozambique would not have
to make debt payments of tens of millions of dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are satisfied that a positive step was taken for
Mozambique's debt -- but it falls short of our expectation,''
Foreign Minister Leonardo Simao said. ''Our expectation was for the
full cancelation of the debt.''
</P>
<P>
   The government will continue to ask that its debts be written
off, Simao said.
