   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- Despite fears of more flooding and a
possible cholera outbreak in Mozambique, restless flood victims
were abandoning aid camps and heading back to their devastated
villages, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Clear weather and receding flood waters in recent days have
encouraged refugees to return to their wrecked homes in hopes of
salvaging some of their possessions.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of Mozambican flood victims, particularly in
southern Gaza Province, were feeling confident enough to leave the
camps. With refugees spread over more than 100 camps, many do not
know what happened to their relatives.
</P>
<P>
   But the government says it is still unable to provide food and
medicine to outlying villages hard-hit by last month's floods and
warns that drinking the filthy flood water there could spark a
cholera epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, aid workers were paying more attention to Madagascar,
an Indian Ocean island nation off the coast of Mozambique that was
also hit by the recent flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Six French military helicopters that arrived on the island
aboard a ship Monday began surveying damage from storms that killed
more than 100 people, left at least 10,000 homeless and battered
coffee plantations, rice paddies and banana, orange and avocado
groves.
</P>
<P>
   In Mozambique, 1 million people need aid, but the number is
expected to decline. The U.N. World Food Program appealed for $27
million to feed an estimated 650,000 people over the next six
months.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Ministry does not know how many people have left the
camps because the chaos wrought by the floods makes it difficult to
keep track of people.
</P>
<P>
   Graca Machel, Mozambique's former first lady and the wife of
former South African President Nelson Mandela, said she sympathized
with the victims' desire to head home, though she agreed with the
government's position that refugees should stay in camps until the
situation improves.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is extremely difficult to keep people in the camps,'' she
said at a meeting of aid groups. ''They have legitimate concerns
about what happened to their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern Mozambique has been sunny for the past three days,
allowing relief organizations to step up their aid shipments by
road.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, aid officials said they would send seeds along with
emergency food supplies to flood victims who need to plant new
crops in April.
</P>
<P>
   The floods wiped out farming fields throughout southern and
central Mozambique, and if farmers miss the next growing season,
the need for international food aid will be extended for months.
</P>
<P>
   International aid groups have said they fear last month's floods
may have killed thousands, but Sunday's confirmed toll of 492
remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Accurate casualty numbers probably won't be available until the
flooded Limpopo and Save rivers return to normal.
