   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- Just as aid agencies were making
headway in feeding hundreds of thousands displaced by flooding in
southern and central Mozambique, new floods hit a remote northern
region Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Messalo River overflowed its banks in the northern province
of Gabo Delgado after a week of torrential rain, submerging up to
four villages. The floods blocked the main road to Tanzania -- about
70 miles to the north -- and cut several districts off from the rest
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of the damage was still being assessed, but the scale
was nothing like that caused by floods in the central and southern
areas last month.
</P>
<P>
   No lives had been lost or were at risk in the northern flooding,
said Silvano Langa, head of the country's national disaster
management agency.
</P>
<P>
   Farmlands, homes and businesses have also been flooded over the
past week in a northwest district near Mozambique's border with
Zimbabwe, Langa said. The Zambezi River flows through the area.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Leonardo Simao told reporters he feared more
flooding would occur along the Zambezi River -- which is fed by
rivers in neighboring Malawi -- because Malawi has had heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
   Water levels had risen Monday on the flooded southern Limpopo
River, and on the central Save and Buzi rivers, but government
officials said they were expected to fall again.
</P>
<P>
   The Mozambican weather bureau predicted light showers would
continue over much of the country until Wednesday, when the weather
was expected to clear.
</P>
<P>
   The World Food Program, meanwhile, planned to move 230 tons of
food overland from Zimbabwe to Zumbu and distribute it by boat to
villagers affected by flooding along the Zambezi River, said Abby
Spring, a spokeswoman for the U.N. agency.
</P>
<P>
   The official death toll from the floods still stood at 492 on
Monday. Langa said more bodies had been found, and the death toll
was in the process of being revised.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign military teams began scaling down their aid flights to
an estimated 360,000 flood victims being housed in aid camps. Four
British and two German helicopters left Mozambique on Sunday,
reducing to 47 the number of aircraft available for relief
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military's six helicopters and seven planes were
scheduled to continue flying relief flights until April 2.
</P>
<P>
   While trucks are increasingly being used to distribute food,
helicopters are still sorely needed in areas where roads washed
away by the floods have yet to be restored.
</P>
<P>
   But Simao said the phased withdrawal of the aircraft would not
affect aid distribution, and civilian aircraft would be hired if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union announced Monday it will increase its annual
economic assistance to Mozambique to $150 million for 2000, a 50
percent increase over 1999 aid levels.
</P>
<P>
   The EU pledged to continue sending emergency aid for another six
months. The 15 EU member nations have already donated $85 million
to Mozambique, and have approved $156 million in debt relief.
