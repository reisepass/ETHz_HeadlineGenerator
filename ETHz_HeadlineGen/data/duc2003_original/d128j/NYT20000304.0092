   MAPUTO, Mozambique _ Saturday's headline in the daily newspaper
Noticias hit a nerve: ``West Closes Its Eyes to Tragedy in
Mozambique.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, eagerly awaited U.S. and British military helicopters
will start searching for those still stranded by devastating floods
and hauling food and medical supplies to the hundreds of thousands
of people left homeless.
</P>
<P>
   But while government officials and relief workers have applauded
the imminent arrival of the 10 helicopters, six fixed-wing planes
and hundreds of soldiers, other people in Mozambique are
complaining that the outside world took too long to respond to the
crisis here.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the aircraft and soldiers start flying, virtually
all of the people trapped on trees and rooftops will already have
been saved. And the flood waters of the Limpopo and other rivers
have started to recede, officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The government, which had issued an urgent appeal for $65
million, has received only about half that amount, officials said
Saturday. And on Friday, Leonardo Simao, the foreign minister,
bluntly told reporters that he believed the delays in assistance
had resulted in unnecessary deaths. No one knows exactly how many
people have died, but relief agencies estimate the toll in the
thousands.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the response had been more quick, I believe more lives
could have been saved,'' Simao said after meeting in South Africa
with ministers from South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana. ``I
believe the inertia of bureaucracy is evident.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials, who have already committed over $11 million to
the relief effort, say they responded as quickly and efficiently as
possible. No one _ not the Mozambican government, nor the relief
workers on the ground _ expected the flood waters to rise so
dramatically on the weekend of Feb. 26.
</P>
<P>
   And there is no question that the assistance from the United
States and Britain is still desperately needed and welcomed.
Mozambique is still struggling to distribute food, shelter and
medicine to nearly 1 million people who have lost houses, food
supplies or livelihoods and to rebuild this country's
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate does highlight the simmering resentment felt by
many government officials and relief workers across Africa who say
the powerful nations of the world often fail to act as quickly here
as elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Neighboring South Africa, which sent seven of its 100 military
helicopters for the worst of the crisis, has come under fire for
sending so few.
</P>
<P>
   South African military officials say they needed helicopters for
missions in flooded areas of South Africa, which also experienced
torrential rains. And they feared that sending too many helicopters
to Mozambique might result in deadly collisions. ``We did all we
could,'' said Sam Mkhwanzi, a spokesman for the South African
Ministry of Defense. ``We were having our own floods, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation was also complicated by the changing nature of the
disaster itself. The first floods started in mid-February. By Feb.
26, most people thought the worst was over.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had already sent in six disaster assessment
experts and donated about $630,000 for food, emergency health
centers and logistical support. Relief agencies had begun to send
emergency crews home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first phase of the floods was coming to a relatively
satisfactory end,'' said Ross Mountain, the United Nations' special
envoy to Mozambique. ``Then last weekend, the skies opened in
Zimbabwe and South Africa. This came down the river and that's when
this much greater challenge arose.''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The appeals went out to the world last weekend, and by midweek,
with television stations broadcasting footage of the flooding, the
United States had pledged helicopters, hundreds of troops and more
money.
</P>
<P>
   Some relief workers and government officials argue that
helicopters should have arrived almost immediately, in the early
days of last week, and that the United States and Britain could
have done more to get them there. The role of Portugal, the
colonial ruler of Mozambique until 1975, also came under fire,
particularly because Lisbon currently holds the presidency of the
European Union, normally a source of disaster aid.
</P>
<P>
   But Mountain said he believes the world contributed what it
could. ``One can always say we must do better,'' he said. ``But I
think countries and governments have moved pretty quickly.''
