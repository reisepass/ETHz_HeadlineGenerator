LUSAKA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's parliament has set up a
parliamentary committee to raise funds and other materials for
flood victims in Mozambique, a senior parliamentarian said.
</P>
<P>
"The Zambian parliament members have responded to the call to
help our brothers and sisters in Mozambique and so far a committee
has been set up to raise money for the flood victims," said Vernon
Mwaanga, parliamentary chief of the ruling Movement for
Multi-Party Democracy (MMD).
</P>
<P>
The parliamentarians found it prudent to help alleviate the
sufferings of the people in the flood-hit Mozambique, the Times of
Zambia newspaper Monday quoted Mwaanga as saying lately.
</P>
<P>
The money would be deposited in the SOS-Mozambique account and
other materials would be directed to the SOS-Mozambique committee
headed by Sebastian Kopulande, former Zambian Permanent Secretary
at State House.
</P>
<P>
Mwaanga also commended the government for donating 120 tons of
food and medical aid worth over one million U.S. dollars to the
displaced people in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
He said the government's response was in line with the
resolutions of the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
emergency meeting, compelling all member countries to be involved
in the Mozambique situation.
</P>
<P>
The 14-member SADC was also working on long-term plans to
rebuild infrastructures after the Cyclone Eline-induced floods.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique has been hit by devastating floods for the past
three weeks. Reportedly, about two million people have been
displaced.
