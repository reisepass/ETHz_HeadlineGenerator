   GENEVA (AP) -- With Tropical Storm Gloria threatening to wreak
more havoc in flood-devastated Mozambique and its neighbors, aid
agencies and foreign governments on Friday stepped up their efforts
to help those who have lost everything to the waters.
</P>
<P>
   Relief agencies said they were bracing for the worst if the new
storm hits.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're holding our breath,'' said World Food Program spokesman
Trevor Rowe. If the storm strikes with its full power, Rowe said,
it will have a ''devastating, catastrophic effect.''
</P>
<P>
   In Mozambique, the United Nations estimates that between 800,000
and 1 million people have already lost their homes to the flooding
and are in urgent need of help. Roughly 180,000 homeless are
estimated to be children under the age of 5.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Children's Fund warned that Madagascar ''could become
the next Mozambique,'' after Gloria swamped the Indian Ocean island
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The storms that have flooded the continent are landing their
worst blows here,'' said Sergio Soro, the UNICEF representative in
Madagascar. ''The island is like a punching bag right now,'' he
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 600,000 people there have been affected by the
flooding, half of them children. At least 55 people have died, Soro
said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. National Weather Service said Friday that the storm had
been a hurricane but had weakened to a tropical storm. During the
next two days, the storm was expected to be over the strait between
Madagascar and the Mozambique mainland.
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF began registering children and parents separated in the
floods, and arranged to fly in 60,000 syringes for an emergency
vaccination campaign against measles and meningitis in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are still thousands of people who need rescuing,'' said
Rowe, from the food agency's Rome headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations said it had 30 helicopters and 120 boats
working to rescue people and take them to safer ground.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Zambia, the International Organization for Migration
moved some 20,000 Angolan refugees to a new camp in anticipation of
a possible new flood.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers said they were concerned about what would happen
when the flooding finally receded. UNICEF said land mines may have
been moved by the water to areas that had previously been cleared
and could cause injuries as people return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Agencies said the response from the international community for
money had been good but that much more was needed.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish government on Friday approved the equivalent of
$59.5 million in emergency aid for Mozambique's flood victims. As
part of the aid package, Spain was to pardon debt worth $20.2
million, the total Mozambique debt to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday, Spain sent three military Hercules planes
carrying a mobile hospital to be built in Chaquelane, a town
located some 100 miles northeast of Maputo.
</P>
<P>
   The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent
Societies more than doubled its appeal for aid, saying it now needs
the equivalent of about $6.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   The World Food Program said Friday it is seeking funds to
increase deliveries of relief food to Africa by 100,000 tons this
year to feed people displaced by war and natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said $7
million in food aid and $4 million for search and rescue operations
were being provided through the U.S. Agency for International
Development.
</P>
<P>
   He said a 25-member disaster assistance team arrived in
Mozambique on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Mozambique's African neighbors have been unable to provide much
aid due to poor economies and a lack of resources, said Brig. Eric
Esikhaty, chief of operations for the Kenyan Army.
</P>
<P>
   Mozambique's neighbors, such as Zimbabwe, Botswana, Kenya and
Tanzania have not contributed military hardware to the operation.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Friday that Britain would
divert a heavyweight supply vessel from the Persian Gulf to deliver
fuel, medicine and five helicopters to Mozambique. It is expected
to arrive in Mozambique in about a week.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal's government, meanwhile, faced criticism Friday for
canceling only about 40 percent of the debt owed to it by
Mozambique rather than the full $375 million debt.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal, Mozambique's former colonial ruler, announced Thursday
it was writing off the equivalent of $145 million of the country's
debt as part of an emergency aid plan.
