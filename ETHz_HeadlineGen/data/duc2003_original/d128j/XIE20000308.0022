UNITED NATIONS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Tuesday joined the U.N. agencies once again in calling for
massive aid to Mozambique, saying that the flooding in the
Southern African country was "all the more tragic" because the
nation was considered an African success story over the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief's call coincided with the announcement by the
Rome-based U.N. World Food Program (WFP) to prepare a second
appeal to help Mozambican flood victims.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, concerned over the worsening flooding
situation in Mozambique, has responded with strengthened efforts
to seek more funds, helicopters for the Southern African country
in a bid to assist Maputo in fighting against the nation's worst
flooding in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Annan, at a press conference here Tuesday, urged governments
and aid agencies to give generously to Mozambique as well as
neighboring countries affected by the worst flood in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
"It is bitterly ironic that the Economist Intelligence Unit
had singled out Mozambique as likely to have the highest growth
rate in Africa this year," Annan said. "But at least that means we
know the government and people there can make good use of any aid
they receive."
</P>
<P>
One day earlier, the president of the U.N. Security Council,
Anwarul Chowdhury of Bangladesh, issued a statement, saying that
all 15 Council members were "gravely concerned" that the floods
had seriously slowed the "impressive progress" of recent years,
particularly in the areas of rehabilitation of victims of war and
large-scale de-mining, and could severely erode the benefit of
post-war recovery.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique had recovered from a civil war, which broke out
shortly after its independence fro Portugal in 1975. The United
Nations sent a peace-keeping force into the country to cement a
1992 truce.
</P>
<P>
The statement also commended the regional and international
relief efforts in Mozambique and urged all governments and the
international community to do as much as possible to help the
people and the Government of Mozambique to overcome the
devastating effects of the floods that began on February 11.
</P>
<P>
Scores of international relief organizations and at least 16
Western and African governments have provided more than 100
million U.S. dollars to help Mozambique recover from the floods.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United Nations has reported "steady progress"
in the efforts by the international community to provide emergency
assistance to Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Fred Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman, told a press conference that
more than 10,000 people have been rescued so far by air, and such
operations were in the process of being completed.
</P>
<P>
The aid operation, which included forty-three helicopters and
120 inflatable boats, was being overseen by two coordination
centers, one in Maputo, the capital of Mozambique, and other in
Beira in the central part of the African nation.
</P>
<P>
"The major thrust now is the supply by air and water of food
and equipment for ensuring clean drinking water as well as the
movement of personnel and supplies to address health needs," he
said. "One hundred tons of aid is being distributed daily. Shelter
is also a priority."
</P>
<P>
In fact, these needs were among the priorities outlined by the
ministers from Botswana, Mozambique, Zimbabwe and South Africa
held last Friday in Pretoria, South Africa. International
contributors, or at least pledges, to the emergency effort now
stand at 78 million U.S. dollars, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations appealed last week for 13.6 million U.S.
dollars to help 300,000 people for six months with food assistance,
shelter, health care, water, sanitation and education.
</P>
<P>
The floodwaters that swept across the country have receded,
leaving at least 400 confirmed and a million people either
homeless or in desperate need of help.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 950,000 people have been affected by the flooding,
including 250,000 people who were displaced from their homes and
are currently being sheltered in 64 care centers or camps in the
Limpopo and Save river basin areas.
</P>
<P>
With the level of all rivers continuing to fall and Cylone
Gloria dropping in intensity, plans are under way to re-open the
road from Maputo to the coastal city of Macia, some 150 kilometers
to the northeast in order to facilitate the delivery of food and
other emergency items.
