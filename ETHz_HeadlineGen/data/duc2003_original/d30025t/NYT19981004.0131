   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Brazilian voters appeared to re-elect
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso in the first round of balloting
Sunday, thus maintaining the leadership of a country struggling
against economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In preliminary returns, Cardoso appeared to have defeated Luiz
Inacio Lula da Silva, the three-time presidential candidate of the
leftist Workers Party, with 56 percent of the vote, a far stronger
showing than polls initially predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Cabinet members gathering at the presidential palace in Brasilia
Sunday night called the vote a mandate for reform, which the
president is under national and international pressure to carry
out.
</P>
<P>
   With $30 billion having drained from federal reserves since
Russia's economic collapse in late August, and the Sao Paulo stock
market down more than 40 percent this year, the Brazilian
government has been somewhat paralyzed by the approach of
elections. It has been negotiating a bailout with the International
Monetary Fund, but has been unable to show progress on structural
reforms that would cut government expenses over the long term.
</P>
<P>
   But the waiting is probably not over yet. The size of his
victory strengthens Cardoso's hand for the politically sensitive
social security, civil service and tax overhauls ahead. But,
political analysts said, Congress will probably not convene to
consider painful economic reforms before important gubernatorial
runoffs on Oct. 25.
</P>
<P>
   With policy-makers at the meetings of the Group of Seven top
industrialized nations and the International Monetary Fund in
Washington seeking permanent solutions to ward off the volatility
that is threatening Brazil after devastating Asia and Russia,
Cardoso is expected to start taking steps to put Brazil's accounts
in order.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Carlos Alkimin, a political science professor at
Catholic University and chief of population studies at the
Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, said he did not
expect that Cardoso could make progress toward restructuring the
government before Oct. 25, because these measures would require
legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he can do is take measures on the administrative level to
cut costs, or to play with controls on currency,'' Alkimin said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gregg Smith, chief investment strategist at Prudential
Securities, said that financial markets were not expecting concrete
reforms from Brazil in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next thing everybody's going to be watching is whether
there is an IMF and World Bank package to support Brazil and
whether the Brazilians are starting to take actions to work on the
budget deficit,'' he said. ``If those two things look like they're
moving in the right direction, it will begin to calm financial
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's balloting was somewhat confused, with about half the
country voting on small shoebox-sized computers that elderly voters
had trouble mastering. Though electioneering was required to end
before polls opened, most candidates appeared to ignore the
prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   At Rocinha, in Rio de Janeiro, believed to be the largest slum
in South America with about 300,000 residents, palm-sized photos of
candidates fluttered like autumn leaves through the air and
carpeted the streets. People waited more than an hour to cast their
votes, with many supporting Cardoso for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Luiz Claudio Silveira, a 34-year-old horse trainer, said he
planned to vote for Cardoso, largely because he ended inflation.
``If you go to the supermarket, you can buy whatever you need
now,'' he said. ``Four years is not enough to change a country as
big as ours. I really believe in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rute Vicente Oliveira, a 48-year-old manicurist, also planned to
vote for Cardoso. She said that for most of her life, her family
lived in a lean-to, too poor to build a proper home. It was her
father's dream, she said, and he died before it was realized.
``Now, the house is almost done, it's almost completely in order,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gilberto Manuel da Silva, 40, who owns an ice cream parlor, said
that he expected the economic adjustments that Cardoso announced
would hurt him personally, but he was prepared to sacrifice in
order to stabilize Brazil's economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking more about the situation of the country,'' da
Silva said. ``With a stable money, our situation will get better.''
