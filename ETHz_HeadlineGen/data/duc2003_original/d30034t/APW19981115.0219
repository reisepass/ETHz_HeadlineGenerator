	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Stray bullets killed two villagers
during a gunfight between separatist rebels and police in the
northernmost Indonesian region of Aceh on Sunday, witnesses said.
	   A woman and a child died during the clash at Kandang village,
about five kilometers (three miles) east of Lhokseumawe, the
capital of North Aceh province, said Yacob Hamzah, a lawyer at the
local legal aid office.
	   Police and military officials were not available for comment.
	   Aceh, about 1,750 kilometers (1,100 miles) northwest of Jakarta,
is a strongly Muslim province where rebels have been fighting
Indonesian forces for the past eight years in a bid to declare an
independent Islamic state.
	   It is one of three Indonesian provinces hit by separatist
conflicts.
	   The other two are Irian Jaya, a former Dutch colony on western
New Guinea, and the former Portuguese colony of East Timor.
