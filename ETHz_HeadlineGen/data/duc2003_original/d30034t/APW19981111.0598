	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Rebels in the disputed territory of East
Timor were holding two soldiers captive Wednesday after releasing
11 others they abducted in a deadly raid.
	   Three soldiers and one pro-independence activist were killed in
the raid Monday on a military post, in which guerrillas stole seven
guns, including some M-16 rifles.
	   Col. Tono Suratman, military chief in the former Portuguese
colony, threatened an attack on the rebels if they did not free
their captives.
	   ``If they're not released, then we will have to use force,'' he
said, adding that troops know where the rebel hideout is.
	   The soldiers were abducted in an attack by 50 rebels in
Manufahi, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Dili, the
capital of East Timor.
	   In recent days, four other soldiers have been killed in attacks
linked to the independence struggle in East Timor, which was
invaded by the Indonesian military in 1975.
	   On Thursday, church Masses and a march are planned to coincide
with the seventh anniversary of a massacre in which at least 50
people were killed when Indonesian troops fired on a
pro-independence protest.
	   Human rights activists claim at least 200 people were killed.
	   On Wednesday, hundreds of people staged a candlelight vigil to
commemorate the massacre anniversary.
	   Dozens of buses also brought people from outlying villagers into
Dili for Thursday's planned ceremonies.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976, a year after its troops
intervened in a civil war that broke out during the last days of
Portuguese rule. The United Nations still considers Portugal the
administering power.
