	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Unknown gunmen abducted three Britons and
a New Zealand citizen in Russia's breakaway Chechnya region after a
shootout with their bodyguards, a regional official said Sunday.
	   The four men, who were in Chechnya to install a cellular phone
system, were taken hostage Saturday after 20 men in camouflage
attacked the house where they lived in the Chechen capital Grozny,
said Shadid Bargishev, head of the regional anti-kidnapping
department.
	   The British Foreign Office initially said the four were seized
early Sunday morning, but later said the kidnapping had taken place
at 4 a.m. Saturday. It appealed to Russian authorities ``for their
cooperation for the safe and early return of the men.''
	   One bodyguard and an unknown number of attackers were wounded in
the fire fight, the Interfax news agency said. Police were
searching regional hospitals for anyone coming in with gunshot
wounds.
	   The British Embassy in Moscow identified the four hostages as
Britons Peter William Kennedy, Darren Eamonn Hickey, and Rudolf
Franz-Joseph Petschi, and Stanley Frederick James Shaw of New
Zealand. They were working for Granger Telecom, a British firm
based in Waybridge, Surrey, that has been working with the Chechen
telecommunications company, an embassy spokesman said.
	   The kidnappers have not set conditions for the men's release,
the spokesman said.
	   The kidnapping took place only 500 meters (550 yards) from the
anti-kidnapping department, Interfax said. Policemen heard the
shots, but didn't react because gunfire is frequent in the evening
in Grozny, the report said.
	   ``Despite the fact that the government of Britain did not
recommend that its citizens visit Chechnya, these four came and did
not inform anybody about their presence, not even law enforcement
bodies,'' Bargishev said.
	   The British Foreign Office said that Britons have been advised
not to go to Chechnya for the last 4 1/2 years.
	   The incident ``will seriously slow down the plan for Chechnya's
revival,'' said Leon Wascinski, head of the Chechen mission of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, according to
Interfax.
	   The kidnappers ``whoever they are, are acting in defiance of the
interests of the Chechen people and are doing so deliberately,'' he
said.
	   The kidnapping came just two weeks after Chechen warlords
released two British charity workers, ending the pair's 14 months
of captivity in the turbulent republic in Russia's northern
Caucasus region.
	   Hundreds of Russian and foreign citizens have been abducted by
gangs seeking ransom since the 1994-1996 independence war with
Russia, and dozens remain held.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov's government has been unable
to stem kidnappings that have become a steady business for some
criminal gangs.
	   Chechnya considers itself independent and has been running its
own affairs since Russian troops left two years ago. Moscow says
that Chechnya remains part of Russia but has no control over its
affairs.
