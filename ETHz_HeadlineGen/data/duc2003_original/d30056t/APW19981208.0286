	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen officials said the bodies of four
kidnapped foreigners had been found Tuesday near a remote village.
	   But an Associated Press reporter saw four severed heads near the
village of Assinovskaya, about 40 kms (25 miles) west of Grozny,
the Chechen capital.
	   The heads were identified as those of the four foreigners by
Umar Makhauri, who had been a bodyguard assigned to the four when
they were abducted Oct. 3 by unidentified gunmen in Grozny. He said
the bodies had not been found.
	   One New Zealand and three British engineers were kidnapped.
	   Chechen government officials at the scene refused to comment.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said the bodies of four men
had been recovered. There was no immediate explanation for the
discrepencies.
	   Kidnapping of foreigners for ransom is rampant in Chechnya, a
lawless region in southern Russia. But victims are rarely killed.
