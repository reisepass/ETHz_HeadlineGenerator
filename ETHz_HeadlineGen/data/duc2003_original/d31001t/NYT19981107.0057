   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ The deal that South Africa's Truth
and Reconciliation Commission offered was simple enough: Confess
your crimes, apply for amnesty and you will go free. If you don't
come forward, you will be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   After more than two years of hearings into apartheid-era
atrocities, the commission last week unveiled a 3,500-page report
naming dozens of people it believes were up to their elbows in the
gore but never applied for amnesty. So the prosecutions should
begin soon, right?
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast. The study was barely in the hands of President
Nelson Mandela before talk of new amnesty deals had begun.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that nearly all of South Africa's political parties _
including the ruling African National Congress _ have key officials
who could end up in the dock because of the report. Suddenly, there
is lots of talk about how the country can't withstand a round of
politically divisive trials, and many political analysts here are
betting that an agreement ``of mutual benefit'' is in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   Already, three major political parties are calling for some kind
of new amnesty, and the ANC isn't closing the door. ANC spokesman
Thabo Masebe said it was ``premature'' to talk of a general
amnesty, but he acknowledged that the party was discussing an
amnesty specifically tailored to violence by black South Africans
against other blacks that littered the KwaZulu/Natal province with
bodies during the late '80s and into the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing a truth commission rather than a Nuremberg-style
trial with which to close out its brutal past, South Africa hoped
for an idealistic reconciliation. People would come clean and
receive true forgiveness. Society would then be able to move on,
its wounds cleansed and healed. It was a model watched closely
around the world by other societies wondering how to disentangle
themselves from the grudges of a brutal past.
</P>
<P>
   But given the chance, hundreds of South Africa's perpetrators
did not come forward. Commission officials themselves say they were
frustrated by the lack of cooperation, however exhaustive their
report may seem.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps too late, however, to press for more. Today's
South Africa has urgent new problems to deal with _ unemployment,
crime, white flight, too few schools and hospitals. So it may wind
up settling for a more pragmatic reconciliation _ one that gives
amnesty to the unrepentant simply because it's more practical for
all concerned to move on.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, truth commissions have gained popularity in
many places, notably Chile, Argentina and El Salvador. But South
Africa's _ the biggest and most powerful, able to grant amnesty and
to subpoena witnesses _ was supposed to be the real test.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the commission forced the nation to see the gruesome
details of its past, as sobbing survivors and stone-faced torturers
told of smashed genitals and near suffocations. And the
commission's work added much to the knowledge about what happened
in South Africa between 1960 and 1994. But it will be years before
the effect of the commission can truly be judged.
</P>
<P>
   Has anyone really forgiven anyone else? Will vendettas persist?
No one can answer.
</P>
<P>
   One thing seems clear, however: Four years after South Africa
held its first non-racial elections, a growing number of South
Africans want to be done with the past.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Louw, the publisher of a respected weekly newsletter,
Southern Africa Report, says a new amnesty proposal could come up
during the February session of Parliament, in time to remove the
issue from next year's election campaigns. ``You simply can't have
this country torn apart by prosecutions,'' he says. ``Everybody is
going to be howling for an amnesty. They already are.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the commission's chairman,
delivered the report, he seemed to be anticipating a push for a new
amnesty and arguing against it. He said such a move would be highly
unfair to those who came forward. He suggested instead that there
be a two-year time limit, after which anyone not indicted would in
effect get amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there will be opposition to any proposals to limit
prosecutions. More than a dozen human rights and victims advocacy
groups have already banded together to condemn such proposals as
``unconscionable.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for a Truth Commission emerged as a compromise from the
long negotiations that brought about South Africa's peaceful
transition from a white supremacist state to a non-racial
democracy. During the talks, the white National Party government
pushed for a blanket amnesty, and the ANC refused.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, only about 250 former police officers came forward,
most of them foot soldiers. And only two high National Party
officials, former Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and Police
Commissioner Johan van der Merwe, confessed _ to roles in ordering
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the commission called the apartheid state the
``primary perpetrator'' of gross human rights violations and held
such high ranking former officials as former President P.W. Botha,
his former army chief, Georg Meiring, and the former intelligence
chief, Niel Barnard, responsible. These men, and others of lower
rank, have not applied for amnesty
</P>
<P>
   For the ANC, the most embarrassing prospect is the possible
prosecution of Mandela's former wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela,
who is accused in the report of taking part in a number of assaults
and abductions. Lesser-known officials could face charges too. The
ANC is held responsible for at least 76 deaths in KwaZulu/Natal.
</P>
<P>
   The ANC's problems are further complicated by its efforts to
make peace with the largely Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party.
Virtually no one from that party came forward to ask for amnesty.
Yet the report found that Inkatha, working with the white
government, was responsible for widespread slaughter in
KwaZulu/Natal and in the townships around Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   Inkatha's leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and many key party
officials stand accused of fomenting a wide range of abuses. But
prosecuting Chief Buthelezi could lead to new warfare in KwaZulu.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reluctance to go forward with prosecutions may be
the result of still another factor: The judicial system is already
overwhelmed with rising crime and the evidence from the apartheid
era is old. So why spend the time and the money?
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, only one political party is opposed to any form
of new amnesty _ the tiny but influential Democratic Party, a
liberal group that was not involved in the violence. Its head, Tony
Leon, says a new amnesty would only prove that ``the more thuglike
your behavior, the more you get away with.'' But he concedes that
his is a lonely voice. ``At this point,'' he says, ``there is
little enthusiasm for anything but closing the book on the past.''
