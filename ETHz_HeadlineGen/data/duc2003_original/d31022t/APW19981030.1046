	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ A fire turned a Swedish dance hall
jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing
60 people and injuring 155.
	   The fast-spreading fire that broke out just a few minutes before
midnight Thursday gutted the building and left rescuers facing a
hideous scene that local rescue service leader Lennart Olin likened
to a ``gas chamber.'' The cause of the fire had not been determined
as of Friday evening.
	   Although an estimated 400 people, most aged 13 to 18, were at
the dance on the upper floor, the facility had approval for a
maximum capacity of 150, Hans Carlsson, the detective leading the
disaster investigation.
	   The fire, at the facilities of the Macedonian Association local
immigrant group, was the deadliest in modern Swedish history. In
1978, 20 people died in a fire at a hotel in the town of Boraas.
	   Police said most victims choked to death on smoke and poisonous
gases; 59 bodies were found at the scene and one other died later.
Of the injured, at least 57 were in intensive care, according to
Sven Martinell, spokesman for the local medical authorities.
	   Police earlier had reported 65 dead, but backed off that figure
Friday evening. ``The earlier information that police gave out was
wrong,'' said Hans Carlsson, the lead detective in the case.
