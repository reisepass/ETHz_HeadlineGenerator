	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's secular military leadership
warned a pro-Islamic party Monday against dragging the army into
politics, after its leader said the party has the backing of the
army in forming a new government
	   Recai Kutan, leader of Islamic Virtue Party, was quoted by the
daily Milliyet on Saturday as saying that they were receiving
signals that the army liked the party's new moderate tone.
	   ``It is out of question for the armed forces to express whether
it likes the tone of a political party or not,'' the general staff
said in a statement. ``Everyone should refrain from making comments
that would drag the armed forces into politics.''
	   Kutan's Virtue Party is the successor of another Islamic party,
Welfare, which was forced to step down from power by the military
last year after it tried to increase the influence of Islam in
society. Welfare was banned earlier this year for anti-secular
activities.
	   A pro-secular alliance replaced Welfare, but it collapsed last
week over corruption charges,.
	   Traditionally, the job of forming a new government should go to
Kutan, as his party has the largest number of seats in Parliament.
However, President Suleyman Demirel has not given any indication
that he would designate him.
	   No party has the votes to govern alone.
