BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Guanghan is a small city 30 km
south of Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan
Province. But, this little known city is home to China Civil
Aviation Flight College (CAFC), the only higher education
institute to train civilian pilots in China.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four decades, some 7,000 civilian pilots and
4,300 aviation engineering personnel have graduated from the
college, which was formerly the 14th flight school of the Chinese
Air Force set up in 1956, said CAFC President Wang Shixiang.
</P>
<P>
The college, assuming its present name in 1987, has also
trained pilots and air traffic controllers for Vietnam, Japan,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Iran, and Hong Kong, he added.
</P>
<P>
Himself a graduate from the college, the president said, "over
90 percent of China's civilian pilots are CAFC graduates,
including some leading officials of the Civil Aviation
Administration of China (CAAC), regional administrations, and
major airlines."
</P>
<P>
The college has 96 trainer planes, five training airfields, a
flight simulator center equipped with several Cheyenne and Boeing
737 simulators, and an aircraft engine maintenance training
center.
</P>
<P>
Demand for pilots has kept growing due to China's rapidly
expanding airline industry. Since 1993, CAFC has admitted each
year about 600 students, of which about two thirds will become
civilian pilots, said Wu Yaoyun, an official in charge of student
enrollment.
</P>
<P>
He said 441 students were enrolled into the pilot specialty
last year.
</P>
<P>
The students will study 28 subjects such as aeromechanics,
meteorology, and English during the four years, and undertake 230
hours of flight training, said Zhang Zelong, dean of studies.
