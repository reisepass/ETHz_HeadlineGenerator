   MOJAVE, Calif. (AP) -- The State Department on Friday lifted the ban it had
imposed on foreign fliers at a private test-pilot school over fears the classes
could teach hostile nations about U.S. weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
	   The government ordered the ban Jan. 4 after four Pakistani pilots applied
for U.S. visas so they could train in supersonic fighter jets at the National
Test Pilot School at Mojave Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   The order effectively closed the school because 15 of its 17 students are
not Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, the government said it would lift the ban only after the school
obtained a license to teach foreigners. However, the State Department said
Friday the school can continue teaching all students while the license is
processed, according to Russ Stewart, the school's director of marketing.
</P>
<P>
	   The current class includes students from seven nations, most members of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, with others from Australia and South Korea,
the school said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuition for the yearlong class is $500,000 per student, many of whom return
to their countries to help flight test their military's aircraft.
</P>
<P>
	   Stewart said the school teaches only the basics of flying jets, not fighter
tactics or weapons use. The school doesn't even fly any current U.S. military
aircraft; its most powerful planes are Swedish-built Saab Drakens, which can fly
at twice the speed of sound, he said.
