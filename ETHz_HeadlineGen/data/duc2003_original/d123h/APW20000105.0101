   MOJAVE, Calif. (AP) -- The State Department has ordered the world's largest
civilian test-pilot school to stop teaching foreigners, fearing the classes may
supply hostile nations with information about U.S. weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Test Pilot School at Mojave Airport said that since 15 of the
17 students in the class that began Monday are not Americans, the order it
received that same day effectively closed the school.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuition for the yearlong class is $500,000 per student. The school has a
staff of 50.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department said it realized that the school lacked a license to
teach foreigners after four Pakistani pilots recently applied for U.S. visas to
so they could train there in supersonic fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
	   The school's owners said they had asked for the license but were told by
federal officials that it was not necessary. They are awaiting approval of a new
license request.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How long will it take to resolve? That's the question of the day,'' said
Russ Stewart, the school's director of marketing and an instructor.
</P>
<P>
	   The current class included students from seven nations, most members of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, with others from Australia and South Korea,
the school said.
</P>
<P>
	   Stewart said the school teaches only the basics of flying jets, not fighter
tactics or weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The texts we use are the same as you can buy in any college bookstore,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The school doesn't even fly any current U.S. military aircraft, Stewart
said. Its most powerful planes are Swedish-built Saab Drakens, which can fly at
twice the speed of sound.
