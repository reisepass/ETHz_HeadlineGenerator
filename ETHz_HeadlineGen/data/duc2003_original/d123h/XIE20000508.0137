Zhang earned his pilot's license from the Xinjin Branch of the
China Civil Aviation College in the city of Guanghan in southwest
China's Sichuan Province. China's only higher-learning institute
for professional pilots, the college began to train paying
students like Zhang in 1996.

His flight courses cost about 60,000 yuan (7,229 U.S. dollars),
and included 45 days of classes and about 40 hours of flight time.
Qualified students receive licenses authorized by the General
Administration of Civil Aviation of China, said Tan Dongchun, dean
of the college in Xinjin.

So far, 43 people in China have private pilot licenses.

Despite the high tuition costs, the number of people who want
to learn to fly is on the rise, Tan said, adding that not all of
the students are rich businessmen, entrepreneurs, or employees of
foreign-funded enterprises.

Bai Zihong, who had worked in a grain depot in Beijing,
enrolled in the Xinjin flight school with money borrowed from

40-year-old age bracket. "They are rich and willing to keep up
with the latest international trends and fashions."

Domestic aircraft companies have taken note of this cultural
phenomenon. The Nanjing Aeronautical Institute in Jiangsu Province
in east China has designed a two-seat plane which will be put into
production soon.
