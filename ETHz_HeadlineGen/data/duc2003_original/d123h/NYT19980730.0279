   WEST PALM BEACH, FLa. -- Harold Martin wants to be a missionary,
but he says he can't preach.
</P>
<P>
   So, the Hobe Sound resident plans to be a bush pilot for God.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, 23, dreams of flying small, single-engine planes to
nearly inaccessible areas in forgotten parts of the world to serve
Christ.
</P>
<P>
   He looks forward to landing on make-shift airstrips in
unpredictable weather to bring Bibles, medicine and supplies to
missionaries in the field.
</P>
<P>
   He wants his plane to be an air ambulance when someone is sick,
a water wagon in times of drought and always a welcome link to the
outside world. A 20-minute flight could save a trek of days or
weeks hauling supplies over mountains and through jungles.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the isolated destinations have no control tower, weather
service or repair facilities. Martin must be able to gauge the
wind, fix his own aircraft, make spare parts from whatever
materials are available and take off unassisted.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he hopes to become one of only about 500 men and women
who serve in a specialized air force that flies in the name of
Christ to hard-to-reach places others rarely go.
</P>
<P>
   They are the pilots, mechanics and electronic technicians who
work for missionary airlines and bring supplies to isolated
Christian missionaries and their flocks all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   And Martin is now in training to fulfill his dream. He attends
what some call the Top Gun school for missionary aviators at Moody
Missionary Aviation Training school in Elizabethton, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to be in a jungle setting in Africa or South
America,'&AMP; Martin said. ``The main role is supporting missionaries
who are there. I might be in a large town, but I would be flying
into remote areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin is a second-year student at Moody and has completed the
required course to be certified as an aircraft maintenance
technician.
</P>
<P>
   For the next two years, he will work in the school's shop to
gain maintenance experience and learn to fly the school's Cessna
aircraft. Upon graduation, Martin will earn licenses in
single-engine private, instrument and commercial flying. And he
learns more than how to fly a plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``His training prepares him not only to be a professional pilot
but his own skilled mechanic, weather service, navigator, control
tower, airstrip construction contractor and airline manager,'' said
Ed Robinson, 57, the director of the school and son of the founder.
</P>
<P>
   Moody Aviation is a ministry of Moody Bible Institute, a Chicago
missionary school founded in 1886. The flight school began in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Robinson was a Moody graduate and a World War II pilot but
was declared too old to be a missionary pilot. So, he decided to
train otherq to do the vital work. The institute agreed. The school
was started.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the school trains more than half the world's missionary
pilots, according to Ed Robinson. Others come from a couple of
small flight programs at Bible colleges, some are retired military
pilots and still others take flight training on their own, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moody is the oldest school of its kind and, many think, the
best. There are 80 students, a faculty of 23 and 17 aircraft. The
three-year pilot mechanic course costs more than $40,000, plus
living expenses.
</P>
<P>
   And most students complete two years of Bible study at the
Chicago institute before coming to flight school. Others must
complete at least 15 hours of college level biblical studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything you read about us is technical,'' Robinson said.
``But aviation is just a platform for people representing Jesus
Christ to be with people who don't know him.''
</P>
<P>
   The school accepts both men and women, but the student body is
overwhelmingly male. There are three areas of aviation study.
</P>
<P>
   All students take a year of aircraft maintenance. Maintenance
specialists have a second year working on aircraft and then
graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Avionics technicians study electronics and communications
systems for two additional years. And a pilot-mechanic spends two
years flying, fixing planes and learning related skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Mkody does in three years is really ridiculous,'' Martin
said in awe. ``They really pack it ij.''
</P>
<P>
   Graduates far exceed FAA standards and are in great demand,
Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could double in size, and our graduates would still have
pretty good job security,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alumni generally fly for one of several Protestant
nondenominational missionary agencies that provide flight services
for countless missionary groups.
</P>
<P>
   The largest one is the Mission Aviation Fellowship based in
Redlands, Calif. That group has more than 115 pilots, as well as
mechanics and avionics technicians serving at 34 bases in 27
countries. They fly more than 4 million miles a year, according to
Donna Sharp from the fellowship's communications office. The agency
has 89 aircraft, of which 79 are single-engine Cessnas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the largest Cessna fleet in the world,'' Sharp said.
``We fly more hours than most airlines. The pilots fly in and out
of the jungle on landing strips that are not the most wonderful.
These guys are really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Roman Catholic priests fly planes in mission areas, but the
church does not have missionary flight agencies, according to Cathy
McDonald, a spokeswoman for the Maryknoll Fathers Catholic Foreign
Missionary Society of America.
</P>
<P>
   Missionary Flights International is a small nondenominational
ministry based in West Palm Beach."They have nine xilots who fly
DC-3s to support missionary work in Haiti, the Dominican Republic
and the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   Martin hopes to fly with one of the missionary airlines. His
interest in missions began at the Hobe Sound Bible Church, where he
has worshipped all his life. Summer missionary trips were exciting
and convincing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Honduras and felt that God would have me work in
missions,'' Martin said. ``I know I am not a preacher and I like to
fly.''
</P>
<P>
   He majored in missions at the Hobe Sound Bible College, married
Kayla Laird, 24, from Hobe Sound and applied to Moody Aviation.
Kayla plans to be a nurse and happily anticipates going to the
mission field, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin and most missionary pilots pay for the privilege of
serving God: They must raise money for their own salary and part of
the cost of flight operations from friends and churches.
Missionaries who use the air service pay only a fraction of the
cost. Pilots and mechanics find the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at the world around me, making a lot of money is
great,'' Martin said. ``But when you die, you can't take it with
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he worried about money, school work and supporting a
family in the mission field, as well as living out of this country
away from family for years at a time.
</P>
<P>
   He prayed that God might put him at ease with all of that or
take away his desire to fly. Soon, he found a Bible verse,
Philippians 1:6, to remind him that God finishes what he starts:
</P>
<P>
   I am confident of this, that the one who began a good work among
you will bring it to completion by the day of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was God telling me to relax,'' Martin said. ``Ever since
I trusted God, he's really helped things.''
