	   MARIJA BISTRICA, Croatia (AP) _ Declaring him a martyr of the
faith, Pope John Paul II on Saturday honored Croatia's World War II
cardinal, a hero to Roman Catholics, but long a symbol of divisions
in the Balkans.
	   Half a million people watched with delight and gratitude as John
Paul beatified Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, elevating him to the
last step before possible sainthood, in Marija Bistrica, Croatia's
leading shrine to the Virgin Mary.
	   John Paul appealed to a country that has suffered from war and
ethnic divisions ``to forgive and reconcile and to purify one's
memory of hatred'' and ``the desire for revenge.''
	   The pope said Stepinac ,''having endured in his own body and his
own spirit the atrocities of the communist system, is now entrusted
to the memory of his fellow countrymen with the radiant badge of
martyrdom.''
	   Later Saturday, the pontiff met Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman at his palace in the capital Zagreb. Government officials
and foreign ambassadors, including Veljko Knezevic, the ambassador
of Serb-led Yugoslavia, were also present to greet John Paul.
	    &UR; Stepinac was, 5th graf, pvs.
