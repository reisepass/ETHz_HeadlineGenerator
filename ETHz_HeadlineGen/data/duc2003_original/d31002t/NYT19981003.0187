   MARIJA BISTRICA, Croatia _ Hailing the World War II archbishop
of Zagreb as a martyr to ``the atrocities of the Communist
system,'' Pope John Paul II beatified him Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Beatification is the final step before sainthood. But by paying
such homage to Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, who was imprisoned by
the Tito government as a Nazi collaborator, the pope also stepped
into one of the most divisive Serbian-Croatian disputes in all of
former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Stepinac is a national hero to millions of Roman Catholic
Croats, and to Croatia's nationalist president, Franjo Tudjman. To
Orthodox Serbs, who formed a minority in Croatia for centuries but
have largely left or been driven from Tudjman's state, the
beatification is a political provocation. They have long viewed
Stepinac as a wartime sympathizer with the pro-Nazi puppet regime
that killed tens, perhaps hundreds, of thousands of Serbs, Jews and
Gypsies _ a regime that many here see as the precursor of today's
independent state.
</P>
<P>
   In his pastoral visit to Croatia, the ailing 78-year-old pope,
who has been in office 20 years this month, seems to be viewing
history through a different prism than the peoples he says he wants
to reconcile. It is perhaps not surprising that the Polish-born
John Paul, who used his pulpit to help topple Soviet
totalitarianism, would revere a church leader who was persecuted by
the Communists and died under house arrest in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   But in post-Communist Croatia, it has been a long time since
religion was viewed as a bulwark against an atheist oppressor. As
one of the few tangible differences between Serbs, Croats and
Muslims, religion has for the last 10 years been a main ingredient
of the nationalist hatreds that have fed their war.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more than 350,000 believers who crowded onto a steep
hill in front of the pope's outdoor altar, there was pride in the
beatification and defiance of its critics. ``It is good to have a
saint of our own, someone to speak to God for us,'' said Kruno
Cabraka, 20, a Zagreb student who came north to Marija Bistrica,
arriving at 2 a.m. to ensure that he would catch a glimpse of the
pope. He shrugged off the complaints of minorities: ``We don't care
about their saints. Why should they care about ours?''
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul has not visited Orthodox Serbia, but he has made
several trips to Balkan sites, always preaching peace and unity in
an area torn by ethnic and religious differences. In 1994 he made
his first visit to Croatia, which is more than 75 percent Catholic
and which lost a third of its land to the Serbs in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The Orthodox Church is unforgiving of what it sees as the
Catholic Church's complicity in the systematic killing, eviction or
forced conversion of Serbs during World War II. Under Tudjman,
moreover, many Croats are recasting the pro-Nazi Ustashe, who were
led by Ante Pavelic, as patriots and founding fathers of the modern
Croatian state.
</P>
<P>
   The beatification of Stepinac strikes a raw nerve at the heart
of this history. After Germany invaded Yugoslavia in 1941, Pavelic
led a pro-Nazi dictatorship that controlled a newly independent
Croatia. The archbishop of Zagreb, a fervent anti-Communist,
initially embraced the Pavelic government as ``God's hand at
work.''
</P>
<P>
   But as evidence mounted of atrocities against Serbs, Jews and
other minorities, the archbishop withdrew his support. By 1942 he
began denouncing Ustashe excesses, once in a letter to Pavelic and,
in 1943, in church homilies and letters to priests. Arrested by
Tito's forces in 1946, the archbishop was given a show trial,
jailed and put under house arrest in 1951. Pope Pius XII later made
him a cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican and many historians credit him with saving hundreds
of Jews and Serbs, but his critics maintain that by not speaking
out more, he in effect supported the Ustashe regime. To Serbs he
has long been a symbol of Catholic priests' cooperation with the
Ustashe.
</P>
<P>
   A week before the pope left Rome, the Simon Wiesenthal Center in
Paris asked the Vatican to delay beatification of the cardinal
until historians could give the case further study. The request
infuriated Croatian officials as well as the Vatican. In Croatia,
Jews expressed resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question he saved hundreds of Jews and others,''
said Slavko Goldstein, leader of the Jews in Croatia, who number
about 2,000. He described the cardinal's record as mixed. ``He
tried to correct some of the worst aspects, but he never condemned
the regime as such,'' Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed regret that the beatification _ linked entirely to
the cardinal's resistance to Communism _ was unlikely to prompt
Croats to examine a wartime past clouded in myth. ``This will not
clarify the period of World War II,'' Goldstein added. ``Croatian
society has yet to deal with something that Germans have dealt with
successfully.''
