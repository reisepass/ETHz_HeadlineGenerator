   IQALUIT, Northwest Territories _ Already the hunters are fanning
out across the frozen tundra to bag sufficent caribou for a feast
the likes of which has never been seen in Canada's Arctic. There
will be fireworks, much chest-thumping, and grand oratory. There
will be drum dancing and traditional throat singing.
</P>
<P>
   On April 1, the eastern half of the Northwest Territories splits
off to form the new territory of Nunavut: ``Our Land'' in the
language of the Inuit, or Eskimos, who comprise 85 percent of the
27,200 inhabitants of one of the most remote, forbidding, and
sparsely inhabited regions on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of the territory marks the beginning of a bold and
risky experiment in native self-government, one that has fired the
hopes of aboriginal people around the world, from the Maori of New
Zealand to the Mohawks of New York. For Nunavut is not to be just
another tribal reserve. It will be both a full-fledged Canadian
territory, governed by its own 19-member legislature, as well as
North America's first true Inuit homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are walking around with big smiles on their faces,''
said John Amagoalik, an Inuit leader who has worked so long toward
this day he is often called ``the Father of Nunavut.'' ``Finally,
we will have our own government, one which speaks our language,
understands our history, and knows our priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   He did add: ``But people are also nervous and maybe even a
little frightened of what lies ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   With good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Nunavut might be a symbol of hope, but it is also a stronghold
of despair. On the instant of its birth, it becomes the poorest
territory, by far, in Canada _ a welfare basket case where
desperate social conditions are made even worse by physical
isolation and brutal climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nunavut will be a rude awakening for many,'' said Goo
Arlookto, an Inuit leader. ``Too many people have convinced
themselves that their lives are going to change immediately, as if
having a territory to call our own is some miracle that will make
groceries cheap and give everyone a job. In reality, this is just
the first step of a long, long journey.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the emergence of Nunavut will mark the first
significant redrawing of the map of Canada since Newfoundland quit
the British Empire in 1949 to become the 10th province.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrations will be held in each of the 28
</P>
<P>
   settlements scattered across a territory stretch
</P>
<P>
   ing nearly 2000 miles from Belcher Island in Hudson Bay to the
northern tip of Ellesmere Island, last
</P>
<P>
   stop before the North Pole. Nunavut encom
</P>
<P>
   passes 769,684 square miles, a region bigger
</P>
<P>
   than Alaska and the six New England states
</P>
<P>
   combined. From Resolution Island on Davis Strait to Banks Island
on the Beaufort Sea, the territory measures more than 1200 miles
east to west.
</P>
<P>
   But the epicenter of festivities will be in this ramshackle bush
metropolis perched on the permafrost. With 4,500 people plus a
hospital, weekly newspaper, government offices, a handful of
prospecting and adventure tourism outfits, a pair of tanning
salons, and two fast-food joints _ Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried
Chicken _ Iqualit is far and away Nunavut's largest community and
will serve as the territorial capital.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 foreign and Canadian dignitaries, plus an
onslaught of media, are expected to descend on Iqaluit. To cope,
snowmobiles are being pressed into taxi service while army cots are
set up in makeshift dormitories. Blue portable toilets have been
plunked into snowdrifts all over town, much to the hilarity of
Inuit children who jostle and wrestle for the right to christen
these latest strange contraptions from the south.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone's hoping for a mild spring day _ meaning, oh, a degree
or two on either side of zero, Farenheit. Which is to say
seasonable and even cozy if that cutthroat's razor of a north wind
would only back off a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down in the States, I'm told, the TV weathermen are always
warning about `Canadian cold air masses' coming to chill
Americans,'' said Joannie Kaludjak. ``Nunavut is the land where
Canada's cold is born.''
</P>
<P>
   And if there's a blizzard on Nunavut's day? Well, the Inuit have
a word that covers every eventuality: ``ayurnamat,'' which roughly
translates into ``That's the way of it, can't be helped, better
luck next time.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the territory is tundra, the haunt of polar bears
and spectacular herds of caribou. No roads lead to Nunavut; the
only connections to the outside world are by air and supply ferries
that ply the Arctic sea lanes during the few months of semi-thaw
called summer.
</P>
<P>
   Dog sleds are mostly for tourists or resident ``qallunaat,''
white people, trying to prove themselves more native than the
natives. The most common form of transport is the snowmobile, whose
rip-roar has become as much a sound of the northland as the croak
of ravens and thunderous cracking of ocean ice.
</P>
<P>
   The territory's southernmost village, Sanikiluaq on Belcher
Island in Hudson Bay, lies 1,500 miles from the northernmost, Grise
Fiord in the High Arctic. But the far-flung communities are bound
by a common culture, and beset by the same daunting problems.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment is officially reckoned to be 30 percent, but in
some villages nearly half the inhabitants subsist on government
doles. The suicide rate is six times the national average.
Alcoholism is epidemic, while aerosol highs and other
solvent-sniffing is off the charts; health officials peg it at 26
times levels of abuse elsewhere in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The birth rate _ 29 births per 1,000, often to unwed teenagers _
is higher than Mexico's, and similar to that of developing
countries. More than half the population is under age 25, and
almost 40 percent of adults have less than a ninth-grade education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone from igloos to e-mail in a generation, and the
changes have left some people stranded far behind,'' said Peter
Ernerk, Nunavut's deputy minister for culture and language. ``But
Inuit are also showing themselves very adapatable.''
</P>
<P>
   In a strange way, the geographical isolation of Nunavut has
proved a blessing for the Inuit. It has allowed them to keep their
culture far more intact than any other native society in North
America. The Inuktitut language is still going strong, for example,
and the survival of traditions gives the Inuit an identity and
confidence lacking on the battered Indian reservations of southern
Canada and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Partly for that reason, the Inuit struggle for a homeland has
been waged with extraordinary patience and good humor, with almost
none of the stridency and violence that has charged aboriginal
rights movements elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our attitude is, `Why make enemies when you can negotiate with
friends?' '' Amagoalik said. ``We like Canada and Canadians. We
want to be a part of Canada. We simply want to be our own part.''
</P>
<P>
   The Inuit are descendants of the Thule Eskimos who settled what
is now Canada's eastern Arctic after wandering into the region some
1000 years ago by way of the Bering Strait and Alaska. Aside from
occasional encounters with the intrepid Elizabethan mariners
seeking the Northwest Passage, there was little contact with the
outside world until whalers, missionaries, and traders with the
Hudson's Bay Company started arriving on the scene in the late
1800s.
</P>
<P>
   No white colonists coveted this merciless land, so no tricky
treaties were signed. Canada pretty much left the Inuit alone until
the 1950s and '60s, when the semi-nomadic people were more or less
compelled to settle in villages to make it easier for the
government to provide formal schooling, health care, and other
services. There was also an insidious reason: By moving Inuit to
artificial settlements in the High Arctic, Canada was better able
to argue that it had legitimate political claim to the far north, a
claim contested by both the United States and Soviet Union during
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Parliament approved the Nunavut Claims Agreement,
setting the stage for creation of the new territory and
guaranteeing the Inuit exclusive mineral rights to 35,000 square
miles of land believed to contain a treasure trove of metal ores
and oil.
</P>
<P>
   But for decades to come, even the most optimistic leaders
concede, non-Inuits will hold the best jobs as teachers, engineers,
health professionals, technicians, and bureaucrats simply because
there are too few natives with necessary skills and education. At
the same time, taxpayers in southern Canada will have to cover 95
percent of the estimated $500 million annual costs of running the
territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to diversify our economy, create jobs, and, above
all, educate our young people,'' said Paul Okalik, a 34-year-old
Inuit lawyer who this month was elected to become the first premier
of the territory, although he has no political experience. ``That
is the dream of Nunavut.''
