   IQALUIT, Northwest Territories _ The day the map of Canada is
redrawn and native people in the frigid north start to govern
themselves is still more than two months off. But this frontier
city, which will become North America's newest capital on April 1,
is already undergoing a strange Arctic boom.
</P>
<P>
   The new territory has a name, Nunavut. But streets do not, which
means that houses do not have addresses, just haphazardly assigned
numbers like items in a catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Iqaluit (ee-KA-loo-eet) has its third bank, which will start
taking cash deposits as soon as the ice clears and a cargo ship can
deliver a safe. And by the end of the month it will be the
northernmost community in Canada to have cellular telephone
service.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 4,200 residents still have to flick on a red light
at the side of their houses to signal the water-delivery man that
their tanks need refilling. But there are now two tanning salons in
this new capital, which used to be called Frobisher Bay, and a
Chinese restaurant, a local Internet service provider and a
Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet.
</P>
<P>
   All over town, construction crews are working 10-hour days where
the wind-chill sometimes sinks to minus 94 Fahrenheit to finish
commercial buildings, dozens of apartments and the new Nunavut
legislative building by April 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to get too involved emotionally over what's
happening,'' said Tagak Curley, president of Nunavut Construction
Corp., an Inuit enterprise that is building the igloo-shape
legislative chambers for the Nunavut government. ``Otherwise we
might lose our focus, eh?''
</P>
<P>
   Curley, 55, an old Inuit warrior in the battle for native
rights, said he felt a great sense of accomplishment now that the
vision of an Inuit homeland is taking shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to be nervous wrecks, many years ago, worrying about
what was going to happen to us,'' he said. ``Now I'm not worried
about tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   What is happening to the people of Nunavut is the latest and
biggest example of a trend across the hemisphere. Native groups are
demanding self-determination and achieving it.
</P>
<P>
   Indian tribes in the United States have largely won the power to
run their reservations. Eskimos in Alaska govern municipalities
where they form majorities.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Nisga'a Indians of northern British Columbia
signed a treaty with the Canadian government that gave them the
right to govern themselves in an area more than half the size of
Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Nunavut dwarfs them all. But despite optimism as boundless as
the sea ice, the capital is uneasy. The extra money of boom times
has brought extra problems. In December, teen-agers' sniffing
gasoline for a high set fire to and destroyed seven new town houses
that were being built for employees of the new government.
</P>
<P>
   The growing mound of trash in the town dump has attracted a huge
flock of ravens, whose mad heckling pierces the howling wind. And
Inuit lured from the countryside by the possibility of jobs stand
in ever longer lines for the night's allotment of vouchers to buy
beer and a drink called the paralyzer at the Tulugaq Bar here, one
of the few places in Nunavut that serve alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been anticipating the negative effects of the economic
boom,'' Mayor Jimmy Kilabuk said through an interpreter. ``And now
they're here.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile nothing but the core functions of the new government _
legislators, courts and tax collectors _ will be up and running by
April 1. Other services been temporarily contracted from the old
Northwest Territories government because it has proved impossible
to hire enough Inuit with the training to fill new management
positions.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 workers have been hired to work for the executive
branch. But the goal of having Inuit fill 85 percent of the
hundreds of jobs has been reduced, for the time being, to 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   And no one has yet come up with anything but a vague, promissory
response to the most nagging question about Nunavut's future: Will
the new territory always be a financial drain on the well-meaning
but sometimes resentful rest of Canada?
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course there is a danger that Nunavut will end up as a
perpetual welfare state,`` said Graham White, a professor of
political science at the University of Toronto who specializes in
northern politics. ``But it would have been worse to leave things
as they were.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenges for Nunavut loom like icebergs during these
final, frantic months before the new territory is created from the
eastern 60 percent of what today is the Northwest Territories. The
two current territories in Canada _ the other is Yukon _ have their
own governments, but because of their small populations, they rely
more on the federal government than do the 10 provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Nunavut will be enormous, some 770,000 square miles of snow and
ice roughly the size of Western Europe with only a few scrub trees
and a handful of paved roads. Caribou outnumber the 25,000
residents more than 25 to one. There are just 28 communities within
the boundaries of what will become Nunavut on April 1, and most are
no bigger than a few hundred hardy souls.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are what the Inuit call the ``high statistics:''
Nunavut will rank among the leaders in unemployment, births, teen
suicides, spousal abuse and sniffing gasoline and solvents to get
high. All are troubles that existed before the Nunavut government
was created; all will be dumped in the new government's lap.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Nunavut remains a bold experiment. Its first official
step came early this decade, as part of the largest land-claim
settlement in Canadian history. Like other native groups, the Inuit
sought control of their traditional hunting and camping grounds, as
well as demanding compensation for land that had been confiscated
long ago by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a complicated settlement in which Inuit ownership
was recognized over 137,000 square miles of land, including about
14,000 square miles where the Inuit also owned subsurface mineral
rights. The rest of the land within Nunavut will be federally
owned. There was also a settlement of about $1 billion to be paid
out over 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the land-claim settlement called for splitting the
Northwest territories in two. The eastern part, or Nunavut, would
be governed by the Inuit simply because Inuit compose 85 percent of
the population.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a public government with popular elections,``
said Simon Awa, executive director of the Nunavut Implementation
Commission, which studied and then recommended the form the new
government should take. ``We are respecting the Canadian
constitution and parliamentary system and marrying them with the
Inuit traditional knowledge and way of dealing with things.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The result is a government unlike anything that now exists in
North America. Even though they chose not to restrict the right to
vote or run for office to just native people, the Inuit of Nunavut
will be the first indigenous people in the Americas to govern
themselves so completely. It will be something akin to Utah, where
the Mormon people, by their numbers and not by law, tend to run
things.
</P>
<P>
   There will not be one official language in Nunavut but three _
English, French and Inuktituk _ and many of Nunavut's planning
documents already are printed in all three. Non-partisan elections
for the assembly on Feb. 15 will determine the first 19 members of
the territorial legislature, and those lawmakers will then select
the territory's first premier.
</P>
<P>
   Under a proposal that was only narrowly defeated in a public
referendum, each legislative district would have had two
representatives, one man and one woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something never tried anywhere in the world,`` Awa
said. ``It may have been too radical an idea to start with, but we
may come back to it in two or three elections.''
</P>
<P>
   While the legislature will meet in Iqaluit, and the premier's
office will be located here as well, many of the remaining 10
departments will be spread out over 10 far-flung Inuit communities.
By decentralizing the government in this way, the Inuit hope to
distribute the obvious economic benefits more widely.
</P>
<P>
   Nunavut will have Canada's first department of sustainable
development, and a department of culture, language, elders and
youth. Managers throughout the government will be instructed to
take a more flexible approach to time, and will be expected to
allow workers time off to pursue traditional activities like seal
hunts, which do not always fit into a five-day work week.
</P>
<P>
   Inuit leaders like Curley know there are many people ready to
declare the folly of Nunavut. ``There are a lot of doubters, I know
that,`` he said.
</P>
<P>
   And while he acknowledges that some of the criticism might be
fair, he points out that Nunavut has not enjoyed the advantages
that Canada provided to develop other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't build us a railroad,`` he said, referring to the
government support that in the 19th century created a
transcontinental railroad that opened up the west. ``Economic
development in this part of the world is an ongoing challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the birth of the new government is providing jobs
and economic opportunities, especially here in Iqaluit. Officials
hope the current boom is bigger and longer-lasting than earlier
ones. The area's first flurry of activity came during World War II
when the U.S. Army, with permission from the Canadian government,
built an air strip here.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian officials once seriously considered building a dome
over the settlement. But when the Northwest Territories were
established as a separate government almost 30 years ago, the
government constructed a hideous complex on the hill that combines
housing, offices, a hotel and even a pool so the new government
workers would not have to brave the cold.
</P>
<P>
   Although he worries that some poorly qualified people have been
put in management positions just because they are Inuit, Kenn
Harper, a local entrepreneur who settled here and for several years
was involved in plans for the creation of Nunavut, remains
optimistic about Iqaluit. He's building dozens of apartments, and
will build even more next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are calling me all the time asking about housing,`` he
said. ``There will probably be 7,000 people in Iqaluit in a few
years.''
</P>
<P>
   For Canadians from provinces stuck in economic downturns,
Nunavut is a beckoning opportunity, a frozen rainbow. ``There's
tons of work here,'' said Terry Charter, a contractor from Nanaimo,
British Columbia, who is working on one of the many residential
construction projects in Iqaluit. ``The creation of Nunavut is
great for the people of Nunavut and it's great for us, too, because
it puts us to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Kilabuk, who was born in a native camp about 60 miles from
Iqaluit, said that as an Inuk, the term for an individual Inuit, he
is proud that Nunavut will soon be a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Though he is confident about the town's future, he remembers a
story the elders of his community, now long gone, told him as a
child.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I can tell you is that they said Iqaluit will become a
big center and have a lot of problems and a lot of challenges that
would come from outside,'' he said. ``I don't know how they were
able to predict that so accurately, but they did.''
