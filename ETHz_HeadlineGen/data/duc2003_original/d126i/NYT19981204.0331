   MONTREAL _ Fangs flash and tempers flare as the Northwest
Territories argues the snarliest of questions _ who gets the bear?
</P>
<P>
   Next April, the 1.3 million square mile wilderness stretching
from Hudson Bay nearly to the North Pole will split in two, with
the eastern region to become Nunavut, a semi-autonomous homeland
for the Inuit, or Eskimos.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, breakup talks have mostly been amicable.
</P>
<P>
   But the noses of those living north of 60 degrees latitude are
getting seriously out of joint as lawmakers and arbiters seek to
determine which side inherits the territory's famous bear-shaped
license plate, perhaps the most distinctive car tag in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The west will be keeping the polar bear license, that's a
definite,'' asserted Seamus Henry, who heads a committee seeking to
protect the interests of the western region as final negotiations
continue in the territorial capital of Yellowknife. ``The polar
bear has been in use by the Northwest Territories, and there is a
copyright on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are fighting words to Nunavut folk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The westerners want to steal our bear,'' said Tommy Enuaraq, a
territorial legislator from Baffin Island. ``It's arrogant, it's
outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have their arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Nunavut hammers home the habitat theme. Polar bears are found
padding around the eastern region in far greater numbers than in
the west. Since Ursus maritimus itself prefers the east, the
thinking goes, the license plate belongs there, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's logical,'' said Chris Cote, president of the Baffin
Regional Chamber of Commerce. ``The polar bear is a Nunavut symbol.
So it's reasonable that the license go to Nunavut.''
</P>
<P>
   But miffed westerners respond they have polar bears, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just as Arctic as they are,'' said Stephen Kakfwi, an
Indian leader. ``The polar bear is just as much our symbol.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, westerners note with a sneer, their region actually
boasts roads that lead somewhere. Well, three or four anway. Still,
you can drive from, say, Fort Simpson to Fort Providence, if you
have a mind. You can even drive down to lower Canada and flaunt
those polar bear tags.
</P>
<P>
   The 26 communites of Nunavut, by contrast, are unconnected by
road. Nor is it possible to reach the region overland except by
snowmoble or dogsled.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some of Nunavut's 25,000 people do own cars, brought in
by ship during summer months. And so what if they can only drive
around their own villages? They are still under the same legal
obligation to register the vehicles as dwellers in Montreal or
Halifax.
</P>
<P>
   ``The supply ship brought 180 cars to Iqaluit this year,'' said
Madeline Redford of Nunavut Tourism, referring to the regional
capital, which boasts a Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet and even a
few stop signs. ``We own cars, we drive cars, and we are required
by law to have license plates.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the west, she said: ``If they want an animal for a
license plate, let them take the musk ox.''
</P>
<P>
   While it arouses serious passion on both sides, but perhaps more
so in the western region, which is struggling with an identity
crisis. While nearly all of the inhabitants of soon-to-be territory
of Nunavut are Inuit, creating an ethnic bond, the western region
is composed of a mixed bag of whites, Indians and a sprinkling of
Inuit, with little in common.
</P>
<P>
   Western leaders are rather desperately seeking symbols to unite
the 45,000 inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   There was huge embarrassment when the territory launched a
contest to choose a new name when Nunavut finally cuts loose next
April 1. Rather than opt for some stirring northland monicker like
``Western Arctic'' or ``Freedom Territory'' -- as more earnest
citizens proposed -- a substantial number of people rallied around
a bizarre campaign to rename the territory ``Bob.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle for Bob won international headlines. But sober-minded
leaders decided to stick with the name Northwest Territories, at
least for the time being, although Kakfwi once grumped, ``that's
not a name, it's a direction.''
