	IQALUIT, Nunavut (AP) -- A new flag rose Thursday in the Arctic  
as Nunavut, the self-governing territory of Canada's Inuit people, 
celebrated its birth with fireworks, festivals and vows to surmount 
the daunting challenges ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	The historic day culminated more than 20 years of often arduous  
negotiations between federal authorities and the Inuit, who make up 
85 percent of Nunavut's 25,000 people. The final result is Canada's 
biggest-ever aboriginal land claims settlement and the first major 
change in its map in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have demonstrated to the world what we can accomplish,''  
said Paul Okalik, the 34-year-old lawyer elected by his fellow 
legislators as Nunavut's first premier. 
</P>
<P>
	``We achieved this through peaceful negotiations, without civil  
disobedience, without litigation,'' he told political leaders and 
Inuit elders at a 90-minute ceremony. ``We the people of Nunavut 
have regained the control of our destiny and will once again 
determine our own path.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Okalik, a veteran of the land-claims negotiations but a newcomer  
to politics, will govern a territory as big as Western Europe, 
carved out of the eastern 60 percent of the Northwest Territories. 
Its Inuit majority is admired for perseverance and generosity, yet 
plagued by serious social problems and heavily reliant on federal 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
	With Okalik, Prime Minister Jean Chretien and other dignitaries  
looking on, young military cadets unfurled the new territorial 
flag. It depicts the North Star in one corner and an inuksuk 
(eee-nook-shook) -- an Inuit guidepost made of stones -- in the 
middle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Through the centuries, they have guided you across the snow to  
your homes,'' said Canada's governor-general, Romeo LeBlanc. `You 
are the closest people to the North Star. And your courage and your 
values are a light and a lesson to others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chretien noted that he encouraged moves toward Inuit  
self-determination three decades ago when he was Indian Affairs 
minister. He took that post not long after the federal government 
alienated many Inuit by forcing them to resettle in designated 
villages and pressuring their children to attend church-run 
boarding schools which often suppressed Inuit culture. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fifty years from now, school children will be reading about  
this day in their text books... when we, together, redrew the map 
of Canada,'' Chretien said. ``Canada is showing the world, once 
again, how we joyfully embrace our many peoples and cultures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nationally televised ceremony was opened by three elders who  
blessed the new territory and punctuated with entertainment by 
Inuit performers. An eight-member troupe danced and chanted to the 
beat of hand-held drums, and five women demonstrated the ancient 
art of throat singing, which produces haunting sounds through 
special breathing techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	Later events included a fiddle-and-accordion festival, a rock  
concert by Inuit heavy-metal band Angava, and a community feast 
featuring caribou brochette, raw fish and musk ox. 
</P>
<P>
	Nunavut's official birth came at midnight, and a few minutes  
later fireworks lit the sky over the new capital of Iqaluit 
(eee-kah-loo-eet). The flares illuminated the ice covering 
Frobisher Bay and startled dozens of local sled dogs into a chorus 
of frenzied barks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like New Year's Eve,'' said Hannah Nutarak after watching  
the fireworks with her two sons. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel, 4, ``was a little scared,'' she said, but Joey, 9, was  
proud about Nunavut's birth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be different now, and better,'' Mrs. Nutarak said.  
``There will be more jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nunavut means ``our land'' in Inuktitut, the Inuit language  
which will be one of the territory's three official languages along 
with English and French. Fifteen of the 19 new legislators, who 
were sworn in Thursday morning, are Inuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Separate ceremonies were held to swear in Nunavut's three judges  
and establish a Nunavut division of the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mounties, responsible for law enforcement throughout  
Nunavut, have a checkered history in the region and have 
acknowledged that some of their past actions were insensitive to 
Inuit values. 
</P>
<P>
	``The RCMP is learning about the importance of respecting  
different cultures, about the power of spirituality and of the need 
to listen,'' said the Mounties' chief commissioner, Phil Murray.
