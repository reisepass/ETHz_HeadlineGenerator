   MONTREAL _ Like the needle of a compass, Kenn Harper's yearnings
have always pointed due north. After graduating from teachers'
school in his native Ontario, he volunteered in 1966 for a school
posting in the Inuit, or Eskimo, hamlet of Broughton Island, in
Canada's eastern Arctic.
</P>
<P>
   But with 250 souls, including 12 other whites, the settlement
was simply too big and _ what with its Hudson's Bay Co. trading
store and Royal Canadian Mounted Police outpost _ just too
urbanized to satisfy Harper.
</P>
<P>
   So he moved with his wife and infant son to Padloping Island, an
entirely Inuit settlement, population 34. ``No church, no store, no
nothing but the one room I used for the school,'' Harper recalled.
``That was more like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for the marriage, it wasn't; his family fled a few months
later, stunned by the cold and isolation. But Harper was in
paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Like most longtime northerners, Harper, now 55, has been a jack
of all trades: teacher, development officer, linguist, storeowner,
and compiler of a dictionary of Inuktitut, an Eskimo language. ``In
my heart, I'm a historian,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He married a Greenland Inuit, and it was during a 1977 visit to
the village of Qaanaaq that he first heard of Minik. ``My
mother-in-law, Amaunnalik, knew Minik as a child,'' he said. ``The
elders recalled him. But the tales they told seemed fantastic and
improbable.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper spent years in an obsessive quest for the story,
traveling as far as Copenhagen. ``My search ended in Pittsburg,
N.H., where Minik died,'' he said. ``Seeing Minik's final resting
place was a very emotional moment for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of New York's American Museum of Natural History,
stung by Harper's account, have pleaded that the moral standards of
today should not be applied to yesterday's actions. But Harper is
unswayed: ``Staging a fake burial to fool a little boy was as wrong
100 years ago as it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper today is a businessman in Iqaluit, population 5000,
capital of the new Inuit territory of Nunavut and 180 miles below
the Arctic Circle. ``It's the biggest place I've lived in 34
years,'' he said. ``And certainly the most southerly.''
