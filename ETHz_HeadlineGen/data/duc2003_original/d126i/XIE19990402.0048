OTTAWA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Canada's new territory, Nunavut,
was created Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The new Arctic territory, was split off from the northwest
Territories, will cover 2.2 square kilometres of tundra, ice cap
and rock, frozen coast, about four times as big as France.
</P>
<P>
That vast expanse is populated by only 25,000 people--85
percent of them Inuit. They are scattered throughout the
territory's 28 communities, which are linked almost exclusively by
air.
</P>
<P>
Nunavut, or "our land" in the language of the Inuit, was born
out of a 1992 land claim agreement, the result of more than 20
years of negotiations under which the Inuit agreed to give up any
future aboriginal rights to their traditional land in return for a
government for their own territory.
</P>
<P>
The formation of Nunavut is the first redrawing of the Canadian
map since the entry of Newfoundland-- which is celebrating its
50th anniversary the same day. Nunavut has been become the
country's third territory in addition to 10 provinces.
</P>
<P>
The territory's new premier, Paul Okalik, was officially sworn
Thursday in Iqaluit, the Nunavut Capital, becoming the first Inuk
premier in Canadian history. he was elected to the job by the
19-member legislature earlier this month. Okalik 34, is an Inuk
(singular for Inuit). He graduated from the University of Ottawa
law school in 1997.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony marking the creation of the new territory
Thursday, Canadian Prime Premier Jean Chretien said:"through the
creation of Nunavut, Canada is showing the World, once again, how
we joyfully embrace our many peoples and cultures."
