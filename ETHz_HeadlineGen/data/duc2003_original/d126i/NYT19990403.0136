   IQALUIT, Nunavut _ Part of Paul Okalik's story strikes a sad and
familiar note here in the north.
</P>
<P>
   Like many young Eskimos, he had no real sense of hope about his
future when he was growing up in Pangnirtung, the next community
north of here. After his older brother Norman killed himself rather
than be sent back to jail, he started drinking. When he was 17,
Paul Okalik, too, was arrested and thrown in jail for three months.
He was going nowhere, and knew it.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has lived in the north knows stories like that. But
another part of his life is unlike anything anyone here has ever
seen. His strong-willed mother, and an elderly grandmother,
persuaded him to go back to school and get a job. Eventually, he
went on to law school, and when he was called to the bar this year
he took his oath in Inuktituk, the language of the Inuit.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a few days after becoming the north's first Inuit lawyer,
he was selected the first Premier of the new territory of Nunavut,
which came into being Thursday in Canada's vast eastern Arctic.
Okalik immediately became a symbol of all the hopes and
shortcomings of the bold experiment in self-determination that
Nunavut represents:
</P>
<P>
   _ At 34, he is the youngest premier of any province or territory
in Canada; Nunavut has the youngest population of any territory or
province, and with that, high rates of unemployment and youth
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   _ Except for the election in February in which he won a seat in
the territorial parliament, he has no political experience; Nunavut
also is starting from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   _ Many consider Okalik's newness to be both his greatest
strength and most troubling weakness; likewise, Nunavut can either
forge a new path or head into disaster.
</P>
<P>
   There is no lack of southern Canadians who see Nunavut as a
well-intentioned but doomed effort, a territory born with almost
total reliance on federal money and lacking the experience and
skills to be run efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Okalik said he knows that many people are waiting for him, and
for Nunavut, to fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't matter,'' he said in an interview in his
temporary office in Iqaluit, the capital city of Nunavut. Wearing a
sealskin vest over a casual shirt and jeans, he spoke modestly
about the obstacles he has overcome. ``Inuit are used to those
kinds of comments, and we don't mind. We like to prove everyone
wrong whenever we can.''
</P>
<P>
   For generations, the Eskimos of Canada's desolate north demanded
the chance to govern themselves. Through stubborn negotiations over
many years, in which Okalik played a major role, the Eskimos
managed to win a double victory that is now being watched by other
native groups all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Inuit won the largest land claim in Canada's history,
gaining the right to some 770,000 square miles of tundra, ice and
frozen islands. At the same time, they persuaded the federal
government to split the Northwest Territories to create Nunavut.
</P>
<P>
   While the new territory is not strictly limited to Eskimos, or
Inuit as they prefer to be called, it effectively is Inuit
territory since 85 percent of the 27,000 residents are Inuit.
</P>
<P>
   Okalik conceded that the time could come when Inuit are no
longer the majority and a non-Inuit could be elected Premier.
``That would be up to the people,'' he said. ``We're a democracy
like anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Okalik was not expected to become Nunavut's first premier. The
odds-on favorite had been Jack Anawak, a former federal member of
Parliament who also had been the interim commissioner of Nunavut
during two years of preparation for the handover April 1.
</P>
<P>
   After the 19 members of Nunavut's first legislature were
elected, they were to select one from among themselves to be
leader, or premier. Anawak was in trouble. He had won his own seat
in the new legislature by only 13 votes. Some legislators were
disillusioned by his performance as interim commissioner. They
turned against him, and the old order he represented. Looking for a
new start, they picked Okalik.
</P>
<P>
   That turn of events may leave some tensions within the new
government. When Okalik was given a standing ovation at a recent
ceremony, Anawak rose only briefly and was among the first to take
his seat again.
</P>
<P>
   Okalik's odyssey through the alcoholism and despair that have
ruined so many Inuit lives has clearly earned him the community's
respect. And it is clear that what he accomplished, he did in the
Inuit way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not very aggressive,'' said Anne Crawford, a lawyer in
Iqaluit with whom Okalik clerked for a year. ``He didn't
necessarily want to win. He wanted things to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Those could turn out to be handy skills in the nonpartisan,
consensus government that has been adopted by Nunavut. But Okalik's
inexperience worries many people. And it did not help when he
appointed Mrs. Crawford to the powerful position of secretary to
the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about that, Okalik told reporters that she was simply
the best qualified person for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations here are high, and some degree of letdown is
inevitable once the celebrations end. Okalik is focusing on
developing economic opportunities for Nunavut's people, perhaps
through fighting for an end to the U.S. ban on the import of
sealskin like the vest he wears.
</P>
<P>
   But for a man who knows what it is like to live without hope,
opening a strong future for his people is most important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that we can introduce high standards for future
governments,'' Okalik said, ``and improve our situation in Nunavut
so that this will be remembered as a point in time when things
changed for the better.''
