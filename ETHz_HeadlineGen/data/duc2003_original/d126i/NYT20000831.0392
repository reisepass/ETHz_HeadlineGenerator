   IQALUIT, Nunavut _ In this brand new territory, where new
government buildings rise on nameless muddy streets, people had
barely learned that the former speaker of the legislature had been
convicted of sexual assault when they heard Tuesday that their
education minister had been charged with beating up a woman.
</P>
<P>
   This dual attack on the pride of this 17-month-old territory
seemed to highlight the rocky cultural transition of the Inuit, who
compose 85 percent of Nunavut's 27,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   Telescoping centuries of sociological change into two
generations, the Inuit, known as Eskimos in Alaska and Greenland,
have moved from the life of nomadic hunters who survived for
centuries in one of the world's harshest environments to a modern,
sedentary life marked by snowmobiles, heated homes and satellite
television.
</P>
<P>
   One price for this wrenching change has been Canada's highest
rate of violent crime, with one attack reported each year for every
19 residents. Last year Nunavut registered 204 sexual assaults,
about 10 times the national per-capita average, and 1,115 assaults,
nearly six times the national average.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, when attacks on women were debated, callers to
radio stations sometimes criticized women's shelters for
interfering in traditional family life. Elders reminded listeners
that in traditional Inuit society, a man was allowed to beat his
wife if she lied to him, was unfaithful or talked too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men would call in and say, `The shelters are ruining my
marriage,''' said the wife of a territorial minister. ``Older women
would say: `I was beaten. If we talk too much, we are beaten.'''
</P>
<P>
   But now younger Inuit, separated by a generation or more from
the harsh life of surviving in a wilderness of snow and ice, are
saying Inuit should adapt their relations to their new lives in
houses and villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as an Inuit nation need to sit down and reflect,'' said
Simona Arnatsiaq, women's program coordinator of the Qikiqtani
Inuit Association. ``There has been so much change in 50 years. We
used to live as families in camps. Now we live in settled
communities. We have to discuss getting along in large groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Across this vast territory, three times the size of Texas,
alcoholism, high unemployment and crowded housing contribute to
high rates of sexual assault. Noting that there are two people per
room in the territory, twice the national average, Ann Roberts, the
chief medical officer, said, ``With the drinking, the ennui, the
crowded housing stock _ this is the recipe for sexual assault.''
</P>
<P>
   For territorial legislators, who have some of the highest-paying
jobs in the Arctic, the problem may stem from alcohol mixed with
domineering attitudes about women. But even with two members now
charged in cases of violence against women, there has been mostly
silence from the 19-member Legislative Assembly, 18 of whom are
men. Although women across Nunavut have started signing protest
petitions, there has been little public reaction from Peter
Kattuck, the minister responsible for the status of women.
</P>
<P>
   From Rankin Inlet, Nunavut's second-largest town, Evelyn
Thordarson, director of the women's shelter, said of members of the
Assembly, ``When you go, you take an oath to serve the people, not
to harm the people, not to break the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Last March, in the first blow to the Assembly, the police
arrested Levi Barnabas, the 36-year-old speaker, and charged him
with sexual assault. According to the police, Barnabas, after a
night of heavy drinking, tried to have sex with a friend's wife at
a house here. The woman resisted and woke up her husband, who
chased the legislator into the street, hitting him three times with
a baseball bat.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Barnabas was found guilty and received a one-year
jail sentence, which was suspended on the condition that he pay
$1,000 to the women's shelter here, perform 240 hours of community
service and stay out of Iqaluit's two bars for six months.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from the Assembly's leaders, Barnabas resigned
his seat. But the politician, who has represented Canada's
northernmost Arctic villages for the last five years, before and
after the creation of Nunavut, soon announced that constituents
were urging him to run in the special election for his seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Levi Barnabas case, people are seeing this and
asking: `What is the point of bringing charges? He only got
community hours,''' Thordason said.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper editorialists say the Assembly, through its silence,
is sending out a message of male impunity. ``The male-dominated
Legislature has been strangely silent over the issue,'' News North
Nunavut, a weekly, wrote in an editorial Monday. ``The government
had a golden opportunity to take a stand against violence directed
at women. Their silence trivialized the severity of Barnabas'
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   But this week's case may make addressing the issue of violence
against women unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers arrested
James Arvaluk, 52, the education minister, and charged him with
assault. The police say the victim was a woman at his home in Coral
Harbor, about 435 miles west of here.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when Arvaluk represented that area in the legislature
of the Northwest Territories, he spent time in jail after being
convicted of two charges of sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were having trouble with him as minister of education
with the sexual assault conviction,'' said the wife of another
minister. ``Now this charge involves bringing booze into a dry
community.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Legislative Assembly resumes session in mid-October,
Arnatsiaq said, the first order of business should be to set an
example by adopting a code of ethics and a policy of zero tolerance
among members for assaults on women.
