OTTAWA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Canada's new territory of Nunavut,
which is to come into being next April, will face a series of
social and economic problems and a tough task ahead.
</P>
<P>
The territory, hived off from the northern Northwest Territory,
will cover one quarter of Canada's land mass, and a population of
25,000.
</P>
<P>
Yet, it is destined to have the most dire social and economic
conditions in the country, all compounded by the region's harsh
climate and isolated communities, according to the Globe and Mail
newspaper Friday.
</P>
<P>
At present, one third of its residents survive on welfare, and
rates of suicide, teen-age pregnancy and substance abuse soar
above the national averages.
</P>
<P>
Per-capita income is estimated at about 7,600 U.S. dollars, and
the living costs there is over 160 percent higher than the
national average.
</P>
<P>
Canada's federal government is widely said to be ready to
provide about 400 million U.S. dollars a year for the new
jurisdiction. But that is considered to be only what is needed to
maintain the status quo.
</P>
<P>
With a much younger population and almost no industries, the
new Inuit government will be hard pressed to provide adequate
jobs, housing and medical services.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the bleak future ahead, Inuit leaders and federal
officials suggest that a government closer to the people in
Nunavut will stand a better chance of solving the problems there.
</P>
<P>
"The federal and territorial governments have been a real part
of the problem," Jose Kusugak, head of an organization
representing Inuit living in the new territory, was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"When you have a totally different race of people running your
lives, it can create a terrible feeling of uselessness," he
added.
