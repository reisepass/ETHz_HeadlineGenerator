	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) - About 100 Kurds began a hunger strike in
the main square of Nicosia on Saturday to protest the detention in
Italy of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
	   Men and women wearing white shrouds danced to Kurdish music
blared through loudspeakers beneath the Venetian walls of the old
city. Several hundred Kurdish refugees have fled their homeland for
this Mediterranean island nations.
	   Red and gold flags of the outlawed Kurdish Workers Party of
Turkey, known as the PKK, fluttered over huge cloth banners with
slogans in English and Greek calling for Ocalan's release.
	   Ocalan is the leader of the PKK which has been waging an
rebellion in southeast Turkey for the past 14 years in a demand for
autonomy. Turkey has branded him a terrorist, holding him
responsible for nearly 37,000 deaths in the conflict.
	   Italy announced that Ocalan was arrested on arrival at Rome's
airport Thursday on the basis of an outstanding Turkish warrant.
	   The protesters distributed pamphlets by the National Liberation
Front of Kurdistan, the PKK's political wing. These quoted Ocalan
as saying he flew to Rome with the knowledge of the Italian
government.
	   He was further quoted as saying that ``necessary procedures are
under way so that I can remain in this country (Italy) in my
political capacity. But it is too early to say anything positive or
negative on developments.
	   ``I call on our people, our friends and the entire international
community to watch developments closely.''
