   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ For the next nine months or so, it will not be
safe to sneak off to a barbecue lunch at Maurice's Piggy Park here,
or to enjoy a quiet game of canasta at a neighborhood center for
the elderly in Charleston, or to walk along the sand at Myrtle
Beach. At any moment, the orderly pace of life in South Carolina
could be interrupted by the heavy tread and blinding smile of a
Republican presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   It does not get the advance publicity of Iowa or New Hampshire,
but the presidential primary to be held in South Carolina on Feb.
19 is of no less importance to the Republican field than the
northerly contests, and for some candidates, it is more crucial.
All 11 Republican candidates have now spent time here, and those
who can afford it will be back regularly, hoping this conservative
state can rectify the occasionally quirky outcomes in the other two
states.
</P>
<P>
   Each of them remembers quite well how Bob Dole's campaign
righted itself after a victory here in 1996, making up for the loss
to Patrick Buchanan in New Hampshire. The victories here by Ronald
Reagan and George Bush in 1980 and 1988, respectively, led to
sweeps in the Super Tuesday primaries that locked in the party
nomination. And in the dreamy calculus of a long-shot candidate _
not unlike that of a hardened Lotto player _ anything that happened
once can happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can win here,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., standing
before supportive legislators Tuesday in the capitol rotunda, ``we
will have the bounce that's necessary to carry California and 15
other states who are holding their primaries on March 7. This
campaign will be over on March 7, and that heightens the importance
of South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the chairman of McCain's legislative steering
committee, state Rep. Terry Haskins of Greenville, said he believed
his candidate could come in third or fourth in Iowa and New
Hampshire but still capture the nomination if he won in South
Carolina. Similar calculations are also under way in the camps of
former Vice President Dan Quayle, Elizabeth Dole and Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, who have also spent time here in the last few
weeks, aware that all of the Republican nominees since 1980 have
won the state primary.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina has a reliably right-of-center electorate with
mainstream tastes, one that has never been particularly comfortable
with edge candidates like Buchanan. Political experts here say it
is more likely to favor centrist choices like Bush, Ms. Dole or
McCain over Quayle or Gary Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tends to winnow out the candidates who are just running to
run,'' said former Gov. Carroll Campbell, who guided the Reagan,
Bush and Dole campaigns in previous years. ``The more extreme
candidates, either liberal or conservative, tend to run behind, and
sometimes they just stop right there.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Bush, Dole and McCain campaigns have snapped up
most of the endorsements in the state. Bush has Senator Strom
Thurmond and Lieut. Gov. Bob Peeler; Ms. Dole has Attorney General
Charles Condon; and McCain has Reps. Lindsey Graham and Mark
Sanford. Campbell's endorsement remains highly coveted, but he has
yet to bestow it.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates also like campaigning in South Carolina for
logistical reasons: it is compact, fairly easy to crisscross, with
three well-defined ``media markets'' in which to buy commercials
and advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Lee Atwater, the Republican political operator from
South Carolina, worked to leverage the state's political advantages
for Vice President George Bush by moving its Republican primary to
the Saturday before Super Tuesday in early March, producing more
attention for the state and creating the sought-after ``bounce''
effect. This year, South Carolina Republicans moved their primary
up to Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, New Hampshire is considering moving its primary up
from Feb. 15 to as early as December 1999, which would then force
Iowa to move its caucuses up as well.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, South Carolina's Democrats did not want to be
left behind with a March 7 date, so they too have voted to move
their primary to Feb. 19. That violates the Democratic Party's
rules that no state but Iowa or New Hampshire can have a primary or
caucus before the first Tuesday in March. The national party is
unlikely to grant a waiver, but state Democratic chairman Dick
Harpootlian said the local party believed it had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we aren't on the same day as the Republicans,'' Harpootlian
said, ``the uncommitted centrist voter isn't going to wait _ he'll
vote Republican. We've got House races here that we need to win,
and we need to do what's best for our state.'' In South Carolina
voters can choose either party's primary, but cannot vote in both.
</P>
<P>
   State Democrats have long felt ignored by the national party,
and many assume that the two Democratic presidential candidates,
Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley, will write off
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, as Harpootlian noted, no one expected Gov.
Jim Hodges, a Democrat, to win last year.
