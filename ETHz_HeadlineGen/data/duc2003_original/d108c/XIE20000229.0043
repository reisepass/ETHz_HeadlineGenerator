McCain's attack on Pat Robertson, the founder of the Christian
Coalition, and Jerry Falwell, the founder of Moral Majority, long
considered an important part of the Republican constituency, shows
a striking split within the Republican Party, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
In the party's primaries for presidential nomination, McCain
has won support of some Republican moderates, independents and
even Democrats while his rival Texas Governor George W. Bush got
the staunch support of Republican conservatives.
</P>
<P>
McCain won victories in New Hampshire, Michigan and Arizona
primaries, but Bush defeated McCain in Iowa, Delaware and South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
The tight race between McCain and Bush has come as a shock to
the party establishment, which had once expected Republicans to
quickly rally around Bush, son of former President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
Bush has been endorsed by 213 Republican members of Congress
and 26 governors, while McCain by only 12 Republican members of
Congress and no governors.
</P>
<P>
Bush's struggle to nail down the Republican presidential
nomination has shaken up the Republican Party's campaign plan to
control the House of Representatives, threatening its strategy
based partly on the notion that candidates would get a boost from
Bush leading the ticket, the Washington Post said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
McCain, with his appeal to Democrats and independents, is
trying to assemble a coalition that taps into the movement started
by Ross Perot and his Reform Party in the 1992 and 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
Bush, who began his campaign hoping to bring new immigrants and
other new votes into the Republican fold, has been pushed by
McCain into running a primary campaign focused on the traditional
conservative Republican base.
</P>
<P>
He has sought to energize the party's core constituency by
accusing McCain of "hijacking" the Republican primaries by drawing
Democrats and independents into them.
</P>
<P>
Some Republicans are worrying that the pitched primary battle
will leave the party in tatters.
</P>
<P>
Senator John W. Warner, the Virginia Republican and a Bush
supporter, said the disputes between McCain and Bush had reached "
crisis proportions" and called for the party to "get back on the
issues."
</P>
<P>
McCain has emerged as the Republican with the best chance of
winning the White House in November, but he also is an
increasingly divisive force in the Republican Party, according to
a new Washington Post-ABC News poll.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, there is no sign that the Republican
establishment will change the horse from Bush to McCain.
