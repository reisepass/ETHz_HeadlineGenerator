   WASHINGTON _ Republican and Democratic party leaders told state
election officials Tuesday that the presidential primary calendar
needs to be prolonged in 2004 to offset the disproportionate impact
of the early presidential contests.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Cole, executive director of the Republican party, and Peter
Kadzik, a counsel for the Democratic party, said the outsized
impact of Iowa's precinct caucuses on Jan. 24 and New Hampshire's
first-in-the-nation primary on Feb. 1 underscores the need to
enable larger, more representative states to have a more powerful
voice in the selection of party nominees for president.
</P>
<P>
   Critics complain that this year's compressed timetable dampens
voter participation, strengthens the hand of better known, better
financed candidates and short-circuits candidates' efforts to
recover from early setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Republican contenders have already been forced to drop out
due to money problems or poor results at the polls even though the
fourth GOP contest won't be held until Feb. 19 in South Carolina.
The casualties include former Vice President Dan Quayle, Sen. Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, and former Cabinet officer Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   The front-loaded primary schedule adopted by the two parties for
this year will apportion most of each party's convention delegates
by late March. By then, Republicans will have staged primaries or
caucuses in 32 states and the Democrats in 29 states.
</P>
<P>
   Cole, addressing a meeting of the National Association of
Secretaries of State, said the results of the early contests will
``accelerate and enhance'' efforts by the parties and state
election officials to stretch out the presidential primary calendar
in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Cole, calling the primary system ``broken.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There now is some concern that this whole thing is moving too
fast,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both officials said Iowa and New Hampshire should retain their
cherished spots at the front of the primary calendar to force
candidates to deal face to face with voters in the early contests.
But the officials said the impact of the two small states ought to
be mitigated by prolonging the selection process.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders are expected to meet in late February or early
March to design a revised primary calendar. Cole said the GOP
leadership might ask the Republican National Convention this summer
for broad authority to enable party leaders to deal directly with
the Democratic National Committee to make the changes.
</P>
<P>
   Both Cole and Kadzik said proposed revisions in the primary
schedule for 2004 will await the selection of party nominees and
anticipated changes in leadership at each party's respective
Washington headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals being weighed by the parties include one endorsed by
state election officials last year to stage rotating regional
primaries every four years, featuring multi-state contests in the
Northeast, the South, the Midwest and the West. The order would
rotate every four years so that no one region had a lock on being
first.
</P>
<P>
   Another proposal calls for a five-tiered system, with less
populous states holding contests first, followed successively by
larger states, with the most populous states such as New York,
California and Texas going last.
