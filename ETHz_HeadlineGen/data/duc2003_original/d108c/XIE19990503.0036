WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Republican Party of the
United States held its first major presidential forum of the 2000
campaign in New Hampshire on Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
Eight actual and potential candidates addressed a crowd of
1,200 in New Hampshire, which will stage the first-in-the-nation
presidential primary next February when citizens cast early and
closely watched votes for their preferred nominee of the party.
</P>
<P>
The eight candidates, delivering their speeches separately to
party activists, explained in a time limit of seven minutes why
they should be the party's presidential nominee instead of George
W. Bush, Texas Governor and son of former President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
The eight candidates are former vice President Dan Quayle,
former Tennessee Governor Lamar Alexander, former cabinet member
Elizabeth Dole, publisher Steve Forbes, Ohio Republican John
Kasich, conservative activist Gary Bauer, radio host Alan Keyes,
New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith.
</P>
<P>
The Early frontrunner George W. Bush was absent as were Arizona
Senator John McCain, and columnist Pat Buchanan. Bush has refused
to campaign outside his state until the legislative session ends
later this spring.
</P>
<P>
Their speeches were dominated by the recent massacre at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, in which 15 people
were killed.
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Dole, wife of defeated 1996 Republican nominee Bob
Dole, declared her support for a ban on assault weapons which
many conservatives bitterly oppose and want to overturn.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you need an Ak-47 to defend your family," she
said in the speech. "I also favor safety locks on guns to
protect our children."
</P>
<P>
Most candidates also fiercely attacked the U.S. role in
Kosovo. Keyes called it an immoral attack on a country that had
never harmed the United States.
</P>
<P>
The New Hampshire primary, tentatively scheduled for February
15, 2000, is different from any other event in a presidential
race.
</P>
<P>
The state is small and a large proportion of its voters
expect to meet the candidates personally, rather than learn of
their views through paid advertisements.
</P>
<P>
The Republican race is more complicated than the two-man
contest being waged among Democrats between Vice President Al
Gore and former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley.
