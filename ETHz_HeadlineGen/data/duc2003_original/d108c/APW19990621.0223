	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A bid to eliminate the state's  
``winner-take-all'' Republican presidential primary received a 
setback Monday that its sponsor predicted would prove fatal to the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Assembly elections committee postponed a hearing on  
the proposal for two days, dimming the prospect it would be signed 
into law by July 1, as required by national GOP rules, said its 
principal proponent, Sen. Ray Haynes. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Haynes' proposal, the state's winner-take-all Republican  
primary next March 7 would be replaced with one that would allow 
multiple candidates to split the state's delegates by congressional 
district. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot see how I can get this thing to the governor by June  
30 with the hearing on Thursday,'' Haynes said by telephone 
immediately after Democratic Assemblyman Edward Vincent delayed the 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The postponement is ``fatal for 2000,'' he said, adding that he  
will pursue it for the 2004 presidential cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Republican Party adopted the change Saturday, and  
Haynes sought to hustle the proposal through the 
Democratic-controlled Legislature before July 1. He acknowledged in 
recent days its prospects were slim. 
</P>
<P>
	Vincent did not immediately respond to a call seeking comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Scrapping ``winner-take-all'' would have energized rank-and-file  
Republicans to get involved in the 2000 campaigns, the state party 
contended. 
</P>
<P>
	Haynes and other proponents said it would make the candidates  
strengthen their California campaigns earlier, producing stronger 
party support for the eventual presidential nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	But the party's move was also seen as a signal to the  
front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, that some want their votes 
to go to more conservative candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed change, candidates would fight for the 156  
California party delegates, district by district. A victory in one 
district would be worth three delegates, with up to two dozen 
at-large delegates probably going to candidates based on their 
proportion of the statewide vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current rules, the Republican candidate who draws the  
largest number of votes statewide takes all party delegates to the 
national convention, where the nominee is chosen. California has 
the largest state delegation.
