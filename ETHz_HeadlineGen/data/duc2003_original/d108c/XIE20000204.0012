WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. conservative activist
Gary Bauer dropped out of the presidential race Friday after
finishing the last in the New Hampshire Republican Party primary.
</P>
<P>
Bauer, who became the sixth Republican to quit the contest,
declined to make any endorsement of the remaining candidates.
</P>
<P>
Bauer's departure leaves four others to battle for the
Republican Party's nomination. In addition to Texas governor
George W. Bush and Arizona senator John McCain, publisher Steve
Forbes and former ambassador Alan Keyes also are running for
office.
</P>
<P>
Bauer ran as a social conservative, denouncing abortion and gay
rights, but he was competing with Forbes and Keyes for the votes
of Christian conservatives and was never able to break out.
</P>
<P>
Before running for president, Bauer was head of the Family
Research Council, an influential conservative group based in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Bush is the front-runner among the remaining Republican
contenders, but is facing a strong challenge from McCain, who won
the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey senator Bill
Bradley are the two major Democratic presidential candidates.
