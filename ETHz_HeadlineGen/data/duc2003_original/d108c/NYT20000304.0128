<P>
   The voting on March 7 represents the closest this country has
ever come to a national primary to choose the major parties'
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Contests will be held in 16 states from coast to coast and in
American Samoa. Nearly a third of the 2,066 delegates to the
Republican convention and 4,338 delegates to the Democratic
convention are at stake. Chances are, when all of Tuesday's votes
are counted, it could be clear who will be nominated at both
conventions in August.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the public attention and the candidates' resources have
been devoted to California and New York, which together have 42
percent of the Republican delegates to be chosen on Tuesday and 46
percent of the Democratic delegates.
</P>
<P>
   But other large states, like Ohio, Georgia and Massachusetts,
are also voting. And New England is holding what amounts to its own
regional primary with contests in every state except New Hampshire,
which had the first primary on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The potential combinations are intriguing. For instance, Sen.
John McCain of Arizona is the favorite in all five New England
states that are voting and that together have 102 Republican
delegates, one more than New York. If McCain wins most of the
delegates in New England and New York, that could offset a victory
by Gov. George W. Bush in California, which has 162 Republican
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Bush could sweep Georgia (54 delegates) and
Missouri (35) and do well in caucuses in Minnesota (34), and that
could balance losses in the East.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is complicated by the Republicans' voting rules.
In most of the states voting on Tuesday, only a fraction of the
delegates are allocated on the basis of who wins statewide, and
most are awarded to the candidate who carries each congressional
district. As a result, in many states, Bush and McCain are each
likely to win some delegates, and it is possible they will be
divided fairly equally.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore appears to have a
clear lead over former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey in every
state voting on Tuesday. And while Bradley may win some delegates
in congressional districts, he may not win the majority of the
delegates in any state.
</P>
<P>
   In all states, Democratic candidates are allotted delegates
according to their proportion of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   (The following reports were written by David E. Rosenbaum, Paul
Zielbauer, Todd S. Purdum, Adam Nagourney, Sam Howe Verhovek and
Dirk Johnson.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CALIFORNIA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VOTING RULES: Single ballot with all candidates. Only votes of
party members count for delegate selection.
</P>
<P>
   DELEGATES: 367 Democratic, 162 Republicans, winner take all.
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATE VISITS: Bradley 26, Bush 9, Gore 21, McCain 29.
</P>
<P>
   California has not played a decisive role in settling a
presidential nomination in nearly three decades, and its impact
this year may be diluted by same-day contests in other big states.
But all four major contenders have poured time, money and
television advertising into trying to do well in the biggest state
of all, and the final two debates before the March 7 primaries were
both in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The most unusual feature of this year's primary is that the
names of all candidates will appear on the same ballot regardless
of party, providing the first big test of the probable nominees'
comparative strength in a general election. The latest polls show
Gore, Bush and McCain in something close to a three-way tie for the
overall vote, with each drawing about a quarter of likely voters
and Bradley and Alan Keyes, the third Republican candidate,
trailing badly in single-digits. Under party rules, only the votes
of party members will count in selecting delegates for each party,
and Bush has consistently led McCain 2-1 among Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush have almost all the support of their party
establishments and the most organizational troops on the ground.
They and their opponents have each spent millions of dollars on
television advertising, although their commercials have not run
nearly as often as a welter of advertisements for statewide ballot
measures.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest political surprise of the season in
California was Bradley's inability to gain any real traction. He
spent a year teaching at Stanford University after leaving the
Senate, and more than held his own in the fund-raising sweepstakes
against Gore in both Hollywood and the Silicon Valley. But
California's economic recovery has almost precisely coincided with
the Clinton administration's tenure in Washington, and Gore's
assiduous seven-year courtship of the state has paid off in his
strong standing in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CONNECTICUT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VOTING RULES: Only party members can vote in primaries.
</P>
<P>
   DELEGATES: 54 Democratic, 25 Republican, winner take all.
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATE VISITS: Bradley 3, Bush 1, Gore 2, McCain 3.
</P>
<P>
   A poll published last week by Zogby International shows McCain
and Bush in a statistical tie. Several factors stand in Bush's
favor: strong support from the state's governor, John G. Rowland,
who has overseen a statewide effort on Bush's behalf, and family
history. President Bush, the candidate's father, was born and
raised in Greenwich, George W. Bush was born in New Haven and
attended Yale University, and the Bush name remains a powerful
beacon to the party faithful. How many faithful there are remains
to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's anti-establishment message has widespread appeal in
Connecticut, where 40 percent of the state's 1.9 million voters are
independent. But the senator is hindered by the state's voting
rules, which bar independents from the primaries and prohibit
crossover voting. New voters and independents have until Monday at
noon to register in a party.
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats, who control the state Legislature, Connecticut
seems poised to give a victory to Gore, whose image has appeared on
television screens far more than Bradley's. A Quinnipiac College
poll taken two weeks ago showed Gore leading Bradley by 9 points,
and Bradley has not been able to cut down his deficit since then.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GEORGIA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VOTING RULES: Voters can cast ballots in either primary.
</P>
<P>
   DELEGATES: 77 Democratic. 54 Republican, 33 winner-take-all per
congressional district, 21 at-large, winner-take-all overall.
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATE VISITS: Bradley 2, Bush 2, Gore 5, McCain 1.
</P>
<P>
   This state is solidly in the Bush camp. Almost all of Georgia's
elected Republican officials are supporting Bush. McCain canceled
his only visit to Georgia in the days before the primary and has no
staff or resources in the state.
</P>
<P>
   None of the four major candidates have run any television
advertisements. Bush and Gore each made a single quick appearance
in the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has the backing of Gov. Roy Barnes and most party leaders,
and a poll last week showed him leading Bradley among Democrats, 64
percent to 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HAWAII &LR;
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, 33 delegates are at stake in the Hawaii Democratic
caucuses. But there has been hardly any campaigning in what remains
the most solidly Democratic state in the nation, and the 10th
smallest, with just four electoral votes. Republicans will choose
their delegates in a state convention in May.
</P>
<P>
   None of the major presidential contenders has visited the state,
and none has any paid staff there. Even the flushest, the Bush
campaign, is headquartered in the home of its state chairman,
Barbara Marumoto, although a telephone line, fax line and post
office box are paid for by the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has the support of virtually the entire elected
establishment, and Lt. Gov. Mazie Hirono, the head of the local
steering committee, said there were plans for minimal direct
mailings and phone calls aimed at getting out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IDAHO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are sometimes referred to as an endangered species in
Idaho, and whoever is the party's presidential nominee will face a
huge uphill battle for the state's four electoral votes in
November. Neither Gore nor Bradley has campaigned in the state in
recent months, though their wives, Tipper and Ernestine, happened
to wind up together at a state Democratic dinner in Boise last
November.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, 16 of the state's 23 Democratic delegates are at
stake in Tuesday's caucuses; the rest are so-called superdelegates,
already selected. As elsewhere, Gore has a clear edge in
endorsements of elected officials and teacher and labor groups. And
he has the backing of the widow of Sen. Frank Church, an iconic
figure in the state. But Bradley has the support of Cecil Andrus, a
popular former governor and secretary of the Interior Department.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans will select their delegates at caucuses in May.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MAINE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VOTING RULES: Only party members can vote in primaries, but
independents can enroll in a party at the polls. Deadline for party
switching has past.
</P>
<P>
   DELEGATES: 23 Democratic. 14 Republican, allotted by proportion
of vote, unless majority, then winner-take-all.
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATE VISITS: Bradley 1, Bush 0, Gore 1, McCain 1.
</P>
<P>
   Most voters, about 300,000, are registered as independents. In
1992, they helped Ross Perot beat President Bush in the state's
general election.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no polls of Maine voters recently, making the
candidates' popularity hard to measure. Bradley's campaign has been
buoyed by endorsements from 10 of the state's 18 Democratic state
senators.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is in a tight race with Bush in Maine, where the Bush
family owns a home and garners strong support from the Republican
Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety-five out of 100 times in Maine the more moderate
candidate will win the primary,'' said Christian Potholm, a
professor at Bowdoin College, in Brunswick. ``If McCain came to
Maine and spent a little money on television, I think he could win
it.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MARYLAND &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VOTING RULES: Independent voters can vote in Republican, but not
Democratic, primary. No crossover voting.
</P>
<P>
   DELEGATES: 68 Democratic. 31 Republican, 24 winner-take-all per
congressional district, 7 at-large, winner-take-all overall.
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATE VISITS: Bradley 2, Bush 2, Gore 5, McCain 1.
</P>
<P>
   Although Maryland is the 19th most populous state, the
presidential candidates have devoted few resources there. There has
been little television advertising, and the candidates have visited
mostly for fund-raisers. Partly this is because much of Maryland
receives Washington newspapers and television. The extensive
political coverage makes local campaigning and advertising less
important than they might be elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Bush ahead, but his lead is not commanding. The Bush
campaign sent about a dozen paid staff members to Maryland last
week to supervise mailings and phone banks. The McCain campaign has
a corps of volunteers but no paid workers.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland is one of the most heavily Democratic states in the
country. By all accounts, Gore has a substantial lead over Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Under state party rules, independents can vote in the Republican
primary and this could work to McCain's advantage. The word in
Republican circles is that the higher the turnout, the better the
chances of a McCain victory.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MASSACHUSETTS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VOTING RULES: Independent voters may vote in either primary. No
crossover voting.
</P>
<P>
   DELEGATES: 93 Democratic. 37 Republican, winner-take-all.
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATE VISITS: Bradley 11, Bush 2, Gore 6, McCain 6.
</P>
<P>
   Even in liberal Democratic Massachusetts, about half of
registered voters are independent and more than 25,000 Democrats
have changed party affiliation to vote Republican on Tuesday. Both
are good signs for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Recent surveys show McCain ahead of Bush by more than 20
percentage points, even though the state's governor, Paul Cellucci,
and the state party are supporting Bush.
</P>
<P>
   A poll released on Feb. 25 showed McCain drawing strong support
from registered Republicans and sweeping every demographic
category.
</P>
<P>
   In September, polls showed that Gore led Bradley 40 percent to
36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Gerry Chervinsky, a pollster with KRC Communications
Research in Newton, Mass., said things had changed drastically.
``Gore will win convincingly,'' Chervinsky said. ``Massachusetts
still loves Clinton, there's no Clinton fatigue here.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MINNESOTA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VOTING RULES: Voters declare they are members of a party before
voting in caucus.
</P>
<P>
   DELEGATES: 34 Republicans. Caucuses hold nonbinding straw polls
on candidates and elect delegates to conventions that pick parties'
national convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATE VISITS: Bradley 3, Bush 1, Gore 2, McCain 0.
</P>
<P>
   This is the largest state in which both parties choose their
delegates at caucuses. The Democrats will hold theirs on March 11
and 12.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are also holding a straw poll, but the outcome
will have no binding effect on delegate selection.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage in caucus states usually goes to the candidates
with the best organizations, so it is assumed that Bush will win
most of the support at the Republican precinct caucuses on Tuesday.
McCain has no official campaign in the state. The latest polls show
Bush ahead in public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   But in politics, Minnesotans often go against the grain. There
is no registration by party in the state. Voters will be free to
attend whichever caucuses they please. And no one is able to
predict the size of the turnout or the outcome with confidence.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MISSOURI &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VOTING RULES: Voters can cast ballots in either primary.
</P>
<P>
   DELEGATES: 75 Democratic. 35 Republican, winner take all.
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATE VISITS: Bradley 9, Bush 5, Gore 1, McCain 2.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain made in-and-out stops in Missouri last week, but
neither candidate has put many resources into the state. The most
recent polls show Bush somewhat ahead. But Missouri does not have
party registration, so it is hard to predict who will turn out for
which primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was reared in Crystal City, down the Mississippi River
from St. Louis, and he announced his candidacy there. Bradley also
seems to have done more television advertising in the state than
any other presidential candidate. But none of the state's
Democratic Party leaders are suggesting that he will come out ahead
of Gore on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NEW YORK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VOTING RULES: Party members only.
</P>
<P>
   DELEGATES: 243 Democratic. 101 Republican. Candidates have
slates of delegates in the 31 congressional districts, 93 in all;
the three delegates with the most votes in each district win. State
party committee chooses eight at-large delegates.
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATE VISITS: Bradley 27, Bush 5, Gore 26, McCain 11.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, most people in politics assumed they knew the
contours of the New York primary: There would be a huge fight on
the Democratic side, as Gore faced a stiff challenge from Bradley.
On the Republican side there would be, well, nothing _ or almost
nothing, as the state's Republican machine once again ensured that
its favored candidate, this time Bush, had the primary ballot to
himself.
</P>
<P>
   What is actually happening is the reverse. The Republican Party
failed to keep McCain and Keyes off the ballot. This resulting
fight _ the first competitive Republican primary in New York since
1980 _ appears to ride on a few factors. The first is a harsh
attack directed at McCain by Bush, in the form of mail and radio
and television advertisements, that portray him as anti-New York,
against breast cancer research and anti-environment. The second
factor is the system: Delegates appear on the ballot, with the
candidates' names in tiny type underneath. Unlike McCain's
delegates, Bush's tend to be elected officials; they are well known
and have a network to get out their vote. The third factor is
McCain, whose campaign would seem particularly well suited to the
state's moderate Republican electorate.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Bradley's campaign has been barely perceptible.
What might prove most significant is what happened long before the
vote: Gore's methodical campaign to nail down support from unions,
Democratic officials and constituency groups. These are the people
who get the vote out. And they could make the difference in a
presumably low Democratic turnout.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NORTH DAKOTA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   North Dakota's Democratic caucuses are essentially a beauty
contest. The state's 14 Democratic delegates will be chosen at the
state party convention in April.
</P>
<P>
   The state's two senators and one House member are Democrats, but
North Dakota has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate
since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. Neither Gore nor Bradley has had
any significant organization in North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   No statewide polls have been conducted on the race, but Gore is
expected to dominate the delegate selection.
</P>
<P>
   Bush won the Republican caucuses on Feb. 29 with 76 percent of
the vote, taking all 19 delegates.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OHIO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VOTING RULES: Voters can cast ballots in either primary, after
enrolling in a party at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   DELEGATES: 146 Democratic. 69 Republican, 57 winner-take-all per
congressional district, 12 at-large, winner-take-all overall.
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATE VISITS: Bradley 4, Bush 6, Gore 7, McCain 2.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has high hopes for Ohio, the third-largest state voting
on March 7. Independents and Democrats are free to vote in the
Republican primary. Similar rules led to his victory in Michigan on
Feb. 22, and the demographics in Ohio resemble those in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has run a substantial amount of advertising on television
statewide. His campaign stops in Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati
last weekend received considerable coverage in newspapers and on
television news shows.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain has little organization in the state. Bush, on the
other hand, has the support of Gov. Bob Taft and almost all other
prominent Republicans in the state, and he is organized in each of
Ohio's 88 counties. The latest polls show Bush with a modest lead.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Gore appears to be comfortably ahead.
Union families and African-Americans are disproportionately
important in Democratic primaries in Ohio, and Gore seems to have
solid support from those groups.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RHODE ISLAND &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VOTING RULES: No crossover voting, but independent voters can
cast ballots in either primary.
</P>
<P>
   DELEGATES: 22 Democratic, 14 Republican, winner-take-all.
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATE VISITS: Bradley 2, Bush 1, Gore 3, McCain 1.
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island is one of New England's most staunchly Democratic
states. Only about 15,000 of the state's 600,000 voters _ or 2.5
percent _ cast ballots in the 1996 Republican presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   Every winner of New Hampshire's presidential primary since 1972
has also won in Rhode Island, and McCain and Gore are the clear
favorites on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush have the support of the top officials in their
parties. Gov. Lincoln C. Almond and Sen. Lincoln Chafee support
Bush. Sen. Jack Reed and Reps. Bob Weygand and Patrick Kennedy are
behind Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But like voters in neighboring Connecticut, Rhode Island's
voters are historically independent of party machinery, and 39
percent of the electorate, according to a recent survey, may still
be undecided.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VERMONT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VOTING RULES: Voters can cast ballots in either primary.
</P>
<P>
   DELEGATES: 15 Democratic, 12 Republican, winner-take-all.
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATE VISITS: Bradley 1, Bush 1, Gore 0, McCain 1.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's core theme of campaign finance reform will find a ready
audience in Vermont, which has some of the nation's strictest rules
on donations.
</P>
<P>
   With independents and Democrats far outnumbering Republicans,
and the primaries open to all voters, McCain will have an
advantage. Polls show him leading Bush by about 20 points. McCain
forces are predicting victory in the election, only the second
binding primaries held in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Bradley is better organized than in most
other states, and his campaign has been well received by liberal
Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has received endorsements from members of the state's
Democratic national committee delegation, but Gov. Howard Dean and
several other top state officials have come out for Gore. Recent
polls show Gore leading Bradley 56 percent to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the attention lavished on Washington state by candidates
of both parties for last week's primary, it was, in terms of
collecting delegates to the national convention, an almost
meaningless exercise.
</P>
<P>
   For the Democrats, the primary, which Gore won easily despite
Bradley's nearly nonstop presence in the state for a week leading
up to the vote, was a beauty contest only. For the Republicans,
just 12 delegates were at stake; Bush collected seven and McCain 12
in a proportional allocation of the votes.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Tuesday's caucuses will be the deciding factor in
allocating 94 Democratic delegates and 25 remaining Republican
delegates. Since the caucuses tend to attract the more die-hard
elements of each party, both Bush and Gore, the winners in the
broader primary voting, are expected to do at least as well on
Tuesday, although both McCain and Bradley have held out hopes of a
surprise victory in the caucuses.
