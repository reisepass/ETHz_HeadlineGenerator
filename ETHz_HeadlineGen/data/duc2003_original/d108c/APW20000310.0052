   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- On the presidential primary calendar,
Super Tuesday is followed by what some are calling Foregone Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After George W. Bush and Al Gore won sweeping victories in
coast-to-coast primaries Tuesday, some began to question the
relevance of today's Western Primary -- the first ever.
</P>
<P>
   But not Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt, who first envisioned a grand,
nine-state Western Primary that would demand the candidates'
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is still a primary. People still have an opportunity to
express their view and participate in the nomination of the
presidential candidate,'' the Republican governor and Bush
supporter said Thursday. ''We've never had that before.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's opponent, Bill Bradley, quit the Democratic race Thursday
and John McCain halted his Republican challenge to Bush, leaving
Gore and Bush as the presumptive nominees.
</P>
<P>
   But both men must still rack up enough delegates to be nominated
at the party conventions this summer and that's where the Western
Primary, which involves Colorado, Utah and Wyoming, comes in. The
contests offer a total of 91 Republican and 75 Democratic
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush underscored the importance of the primary with a visit
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm here because I want to remind people that it's important
to go to the polls tomorrow,'' he said at an airport rally in
Provo, Utah, before heading for an appearance in Cheyenne, Wyo. ''I
know Senator McCain has effectively taken his name out of
contention, but there's still a primary.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, Bush had won 617 of the 1,034 delegates needed on the
Republican side, and Gore had 1,479 of the 2,170 needed for the
Democratic nomination, according to the AP's count.
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates also have noticed the primary.
</P>
<P>
   McCain focused most of his efforts on Colorado before he
withdrew, and GOP underdog Alan Keyes drew a record crowd of 4,000
to speech Wednesday in Orem, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though the vote will be after Senator McCain pulled out,
campaigns had to be contemplating Western issues,'' said Leavitt.
He noted that during Bush's visit Thursday the two discussed
Western land issues and educational accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the pair of candidate withdrawals, some say other
factors will contribute to low turnout: It is the primary's first
run and voting is on a Friday -- an odd day for elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think if we get 20 percent (turnout) that would be quite a
bit,'' said Meghan Holbrook, chairwoman of the Utah Democratic
Party. But, she added, ''I think the fact that it gives people at
least a voice in the presidential process is extremely
significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Others argue that turnout shouldn't be the only measure of
success.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first time Utah's had a seat at the table in the
process,'' said Scott Simpson, executive director of the Utah
Republican Party. ''This is going to be a different animal. ...
You're going to have to be a little forgiving.''
</P>
<P>
   Bud Scruggs, a former Brigham Young University political
scientist, expects some of the states that shunned the primary to
jump on the bandwagon in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, Montana and
South Dakota nixed Leavitt's idea until just two states remained --
Colorado and Utah. The Wyoming Republican Party later agreed to
hold its caucus in conjunction with the primary.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this year it has to be seen as a step in a larger
process and one that is more likely to be punctuation than power,''
Scruggs said. ''I think the experience of this year will only
heighten the interests of neighboring states to be part of a
Western Primary.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ted Wilson, director of the University of Utah's Hinckley
Institute of Politics, was skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they're all looking at the money and saying, 'Hey, we
don't want to spend $600,000 to be an exclamation point,''' he
said. ''When you're parked right next to Super Tuesday ... there's
just no chance of having the kind of influence where they'd (the
candidates) be out here making promises.''
