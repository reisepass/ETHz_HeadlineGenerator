   NEW YORK _ A federal grand jury in Manhattan returned a
238-count indictment Wednesday charging the Saudi exile Osama bin
Laden with conspiring to bomb two U.S. embassies in Africa in
August and with committing acts of terrorism against Americans
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials immediately announced that they were
offering two rewards of $5 million each for information leading to
the arrest or conviction of bin Laden and another man charged
Wednesday, Muhammad Atef, who was described as bin Laden's chief
military commander.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden is believed to be living in Afghanistan under the
protection of the Taliban, the Islamic fundamentalist movement that
rules that country. Atef's whereabouts are unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also unsealed an earlier indictment, issued in June,
that included similar but less detailed charges against bin Laden.
That indictment was returned before the embassy bombings and was
the result of a two-year investigation into his activities in
Somalia and Saudi Arabia, as well as reports that he had
connections to a circle of Islamic militants in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The new indictment, which supersedes the June action, accused
bin Laden of leading a vast terrorist conspiracy from 1989 to the
present, in which he was said to be working in concert with
governments, including those of Sudan, Iraq and Iran, and terrorist
groups, to build weapons and attack American military
installations.
</P>
<P>
   But the indictment gives few details of bin Laden's alleged
involvement in the embassy attacks. The indictment does not, for
example, specify whether prosecutors have evidence that bin Laden
gave direct orders to those who carried out the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in the document indicates why the original indictment
was kept secret for months, but the secret charges were returned
about the time that American officials were plotting a possible
raid into Afghanistan to arrest bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said, ``It's very
common to have sealed indictments when you're trying to apprehend
those who are indicted.''
</P>
<P>
   Both indictments offer new information about bin Laden's
operations, including one deal he is said to have struck with Iraq
to cooperate in the development of weapons in return for bin
Laden's agreeing not to work against that country.
</P>
<P>
   No details were given about whether the alleged deal with Iraq
led to the development of actual weapons for bin Laden's group,
which is called Al Qaeda.
</P>
<P>
   The government said Wednesday that bin Laden's group had used
private relief groups ``as conduits for transmitting funds'' for Al
Qaeda. The groups were not identified.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also said bin Laden's group had conducted internal
investigations of its members and their associates, trying to
detect who might be acting as informants, and had killed those who
had been suspected of collaborating with ``enemies of the
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The government indicated earlier that its knowledge of bin
Laden's activities stemmed in part from the cooperation of one such
informant, who it said Wednesday had worked for bin Laden,
transporting weapons and explosives, helping to buy land for his
training camps and assisting in running his finances.
</P>
<P>
   While the June indictment against bin Laden suggested that the
government had a great deal of knowledge of his dealings in the
months before the embassy attacks, the new charges are an
indication of how quickly the government has worked to solve the
embassy attacks, which occurred just three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White said bin Laden was charged with ``plotting and
carrying out the most heinous acts of international terrorism and
murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing the more than 250 people killed in the embassy attacks
and the more than 1,000 wounded, she added, ``In a greater sense,
all of the citizens of the world are also victims whenever and
wherever the cruel and cowardly acts of international terrorism
strike.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation of bin Laden is continuing, said Ms. White and
Lewis D. Schiliro, assistant director of the FBI in New York, whose
agents have fanned out around the world to look into the embassy
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our investigative strategy is clear,'' Schiliro said. ``We
will identify, locate and prosecute all those responsible, right up
the line, from those who constructed and delivered the bombs to
those who paid for them and ordered it done.''
