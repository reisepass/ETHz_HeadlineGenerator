BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese police will continue to
strengthen cooperation with their colleagues in other parts of the
world to strike back against international drug crime.
</P>
<P>
China's Public Security Minister Jia Chunwang made the above
remarks when addressing to today's opening ceremony of the Fifth
ICPO-Interpol Heroin Conference in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Jia said that as the planting, production and using of drugs
are on the rise across the globe, law-enforcement departments in
all countries are facing the challenge of rampant drug-related
crimes.
</P>
<P>
To root out this problem, governments of all countries,
especially related law-enforcement departments, should strengthen
their cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China's major drug problem is heroin
trafficking from the Golden Triangle area bordering southwestern
China. The unbridled narcotics dealing and use in the area has
turned the country into a drug transporting channel as well as a
victim of drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the number of registered drug users in China amounted
to 680,000, according to statistics.
</P>
<P>
For many years, Chinese police have fought to block the flow of
drugs from the Golden Triangle to the Chinese mainland, and have
scored remarkable achievements, Jia added.
</P>
<P>
Jia promised that the Chinese Government will continue to work
together with countries bordering this area. In the meantime, it
will reinforce collaboration with ICPO-Interpol and other
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
The conference attracted more than 200 representatives from
over 60 countries and international organizations, including ICPO-
Interpol secretary-general Raymond Kendall.
