insurance fraud

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Police from 24 countries and two
international organizations convened in Bulgaria's capital Monday
to discuss joint action against a surge in car thefts, smuggling
and insurance fraud after the end of the Cold War.
	   ``The movement of stolen vehicles became a serious problem ...
after the changes in central and eastern Europe,'' said Interpol
General Secretary Raymond Kendall told participants in the meeting.
	   ``The integration of criminal structures in Europe proved to be
much easier than the integration of states,'' said Bulgaria's
Interior Minister Bogomil Bonev referring to international criminal
groups running international smuggling routes for cars stolen in
the West.
	   Interpol head office in Lyon, France, has registered more than 1
million car thefts so far, Kendall said.
	   ``Some 30-35 percent of those vehicles are subject of contraband
and illegal deals,'' said Kiril Radev, head of Bulgaria's police
unit dealing with organized crime.
	   Kendall said that in the past couple of years, car thefts have
decreased because producers sophisticated security equipment and
police forces in different countries improved their cooperation.
	   But he added that the effect was expected to be undone by a rise
in insurance frauds, where car-owners allow their vehicles to be
stolen and smuggled in order to be paid the insurance. Kendall
wouldn't quote any specific figures.
	   Western cars were smuggled to Bulgaria most often through the
Czech Republic, Croatia and Bosnia and were either locally sold or
smuggled further to Greece, Macedonia and Albania or to former
Soviet republics and the Middle East, Radev said.
	   He added that illegal workshops where car identity numbers and
papers are forged exist in all countries which lie on contraband
routes.
	   ``Organized criminal groups dispose with very good technical and
communication equipment,'' Radev said. ``They step up efforts too
penetrate different levels of public administration.''
	   Only in the first half of this year Bulgaria has arrested 128
suspects in breaking three international car-smuggling channels,
Radev said.
	   In the largest single seizure in August police impounded 20
luxury vehicles stolen in Canada and intended for local sale or
re-export after being shipped in containers via Greece.
	   Car thefts in Bulgaria itself have fallen to 8,443 last year
from 18,952 in 1994, reflecting new legislation against organized
crime that grew rampant after the fall of communism in 1989.
	   Bulgaria's government has refused to issue licenses to six
insurance companies suspected in unofficially employing racketeer
groups which blackmail car-owners buy their insurance.
	   Bonev said some of those companies were suspected of amassing
their initial capital by trafficking stolen cars from Italy to the
Middle East via Bulgaria. He wouldn't name the suspects.
	   In other steps against car theft Bulgaria has joined Interpol
database enabling it to check the origin of all imported vehicles.
The Balkan country has opened four x-ray laboratories to identify
forged engine and chassis numbers and introduced government
licensing of spare-part dealers.
