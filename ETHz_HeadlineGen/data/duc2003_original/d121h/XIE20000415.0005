VIENNA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- China is willing to enhance
cooperation with all other countries and international
organizations in fighting against cross-border organized crime,
Chinese Minister of Justice Gao Changli said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 10th UN congress on crime prevention and
offenders treatment, Gao said that since the situation on cross-
border organized crime has grown increasingly serious, "we could
not be successful in coping with this challenge without thorough
international cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Gao, who led the Chinese delegation to the congress, said the
international community, including the UN and all member states,
must further examine the state of cross-border organized crime and
take effective preventive steps against such crime in various
forms.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on China's measures against organized crime, Gao said,
China has a sound domestic legal system, which constitutes the
basis for fruitful international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China's Criminal Law, revised in 1997 to define the
organization of and participation in organized crime and money-
laundering as criminal acts, has become more biting, Gao said.
</P>
<P>
China established special agencies responsible for the control
and prevention of organized crime in the early 1990s, he said. In
recent years, the Chinese law enforcement agencies intensified
their campaigns against criminal groups of Mafia nature involved
in smuggling and economic crimes.
</P>
<P>
China has signed with 31 countries 33 bilateral agreements on
legal cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We have also signed extradition treaties with 11 countries and
acceded to over 20 multilateral conventions relating to or
including articles on mutual legal assistance," he said.
</P>
<P>
State leaders, ministers and representatives of over 150
countries, and representatives from UN and other international
institutions and non-governmental organizations are participating
in the eight-day meeting, which started on April 10.
