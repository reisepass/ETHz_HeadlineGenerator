<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A Menlo Park, Calif., consulting firm is working
with Interpol, the international police organization, to create a
worldwide network that would act as an early warning system to help
companies protect themselves from cyber attacks.
</P>
<P>
   AtomicTangerine, a 7-month-old commercial spin-off of the
nonprofit SRI International, plans to spend millions of dollars on
the Web-based system, which companies and organizations would use
free of cost, said chief executive Jonathan Fornaci.
</P>
<P>
   Although few details have been worked out, an agreement was
reached when Fornaci visited the organization's headquarters in
Lyon, France, last week. Fornaci said the system would be
operational October 18.
</P>
<P>
   However, in a phone interview with the Associated Press,
Interpol Secretary General Raymond Kendall said that Interpol will
decide by mid-October whether to accept the company's proposal. He
said the agency needed to explore the legal and technical
implications of the project.
</P>
<P>
   If a partnership is reached, it would be the first time the
international police agency has paired with a private company to
fight Internet crime, Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
   Interpol would make available vast amounts of its data on
Internet crimes in its 178 member nations, which include the United
States, and in turn, it would have access to information gathered
by private companies, said Fornaci.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a company gets attacked (by hackers), they would share
that information,'' Fornaci said. Many companies avoid reporting
hacker attacks because they fear damage to their stock value or
their reputation. Using the system, companies would be guaranteed
anonymity and therefore feel free to report details of attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Interpol and AtomicTangerine announced their intention to work
together at an Internet Defense Summit the consultancy co-hosted
last month, which was attended by Interpol representatives as well
as people from Microsoft, AT&AMP;T and other large companies. Via
satellite link from Brussels, Kendall told summit attendees that
``the private sector must defend itself because government agencies
do not have the technology to do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   AtomicTangerine had just invested $20 million in a free
information service called NetRadar, which provides warnings about
potential hacking threats worldwide. For its project with Interpol,
the company plans to create a broader version of NetRadar, along
with an infrastructure that would let worldwide companies report
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall said he is willing to consider AtomicTangerine's offer
because cybercrime is largely uncharted territory for most law
officers _ and governments have found it difficult to coordinate
cross-border efforts to combat this new phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``In police terms, usually when you come across a new type of
crime, the general reaction is to create a special group,'' Kendall
said. ``But there's a limit to how you can transform police
officers or detectives into technicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Interpol has about a half-dozen investigators devoted to
Internet crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my personal opinion that everything that's done in this
area develops very quickly,'' Kendall said in explaining the
reasoning behind a possible partnership with AtomicTangerine. ``So
the response has to be very quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Cybercriminals leave the digital equivalent of fingerprints, but
investigators need to move quickly to uncover them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governments are no longer in a position to be all things to
all people,'' Kendall said. ``The response of the private sector
will be fast because they have an incentive to be fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Justice Department,
lack the staff to investigate and prosecute most cybercrimes _ from
break-ins to data destruction and theft to damaging viruses.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, cybercriminals are breaking into or paralyzing Web
sites with little fear of retribution, costing the private sector
hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   While it may seem strange that Interpol would choose a
little-known startup as a crime-fighting partner, Fornaci said that
the joint project would be built on technology and expertise
created by SRI International, which spun off AtomicTangerine in
January. SRI International, Menlo Park's third-largest employer,
has been around for a half-century and received the first message
ever sent on Arpanet, predecessor to the modern Internet. SRI is
also credited with inventing the computer mouse.
</P>
<P>
   AtomicTangerine already runs a similar information network on a
smaller scale for its International Information Integrity
Institute, a group of about 75 international companies and
government entities that includes the National Security Agency.
Known as I-4, the invitation-only group was started in 1986 by SRI.
</P>
<P>
   Interpol, known formally as the International Criminal Police
Organization, was founded in 1923 to track fugitives and
investigate international crime. Its representative in the United
States is the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
