HONG KONG, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The visiting China Interpol
chief today expressed confidence in Hong Kong's smooth transition
and its prosperity and stability, while assuring closer
cooperation between the inland and Hong Kong police after Hong
Kong returns to China on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Entao, head of China's National Central Bureau of the
International Police Organization (Interpol), made the remarks
after meeting with Eddie Hui Ki-on, Hong Kong's police
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
The two officials reviewed the crimes situation in both the
inland and Hong Kong, cooperation between the two in combating
organized crimes, drug trafficking and economic or commercial crimes
and other questions at the 24th working meeting between the
inland and Hong Kong police within the framework of Interpol.
</P>
<P>
Public order throughout China's mainland, including Guangdong
Province which borders on Hong Kong, greatly improved in the first
10 months of this year thanks to the "Strike Hard" campaign, said
Zhu, who is also assistant minister of Public Security.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the number of crimes went down by some two percent
over last year, the first decline in the past several years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Hong Kong which is known as a secure city, crimes
also recorded a sharp decrease of 13 percent, according to Hui.
</P>
<P>
On organized crimes, Zhu reiterated that the Chinese mainland
will never allow criminal organizations to recruit members or
commit offenses on its territory, nor will it become a shelter for
those organizations based in either Hong Kong or Macao.
</P>
<P>
He continued to say the inland and Hong Kong will join hands
in combating narcotics offences and cross-border crimes in an
effort to create a good public order for both sides.
</P>
<P>
Twenty suspects wanted by Hong Kong police were returned to
Hong Kong from the Chinese mainland this year.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, hailed as effective by both sides, has been held
twice a year in Hong Kong and Beijing alternately since 1985.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong police, now a branch of Britain's National Central
Bureau of Interpol, will become a branch of China's National
Central Bureau of Interpol in mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
Both sides foresaw closer links in accordance with the
principle of "one country, two systems" and the Basic Law of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region after the handover and
pledged enhanced exchanges in such fields as rapid reaction,
intelligence and staff training.
