	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Interpol must modernize if it wants to
effectively fight increasingly sophisticated crime syndicates in
the next century, the police organization's president said
Thursday.
	   The criminal environment has changed at ``much greater pace''
than Interpol, Toshinori Kanemoto told the opening session of the
67th general assembly of the International Criminal Police
Organization.
	   A failure to modernize Interpol could mean the organization
``risks being displaced against a backdrop of international
organized crime,'' he said.
	   Kanemoto said a new Interpol strategy will be discussed at the
six-day assembly and, if adopted, would be put into effect next
January.
	   The former Japanese police official said the assembly also will
discuss terrorism, which he called one of the ``new forms of
criminality,'' as well as the illegal drug trade and money
laundering.
	   With crime becoming increasingly sophisticated, Kanemoto said,
it has become harder for police officials to gather evidence for
prosecution. He said these new challenges require increased
cooperation, particularly through Interpol.
	   The police officials are expected to discuss a strategic
development plan aimed making Interpol more proactive by
re-examining the needs of the group's 177-member states, Kanemoto
said.
	   Details of the plan were not available, but officials said it
would call for more exacting selection procedures for staff of
Interpol and increasing the focus on analysis.
	   The strategy could also seek to target outside sources of
funding, such as from the private sector, since increased funding
is key to Interpol's continued viability, Kanemoto said.
	   Egypt's Interior Minister Habib el-Adli urged Interpol member
states to cooperate in combating what he called the global
phenomenon of terrorism, and added that ``hesitation in the face of
terrorism is impossible.''
	   The issue is of prime importance to Egypt, where 67 foreign
tourists were murdered in two terrorist attacks within three months
last year.
