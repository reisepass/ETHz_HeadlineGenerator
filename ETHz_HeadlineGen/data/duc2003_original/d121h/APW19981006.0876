	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The 15 European Union nations and 11 neighbors
pledged to join forces Tuesday to fight against organized crime,
child pornography and cross-border pollution.
	   Their foreign ministers said in a statement after a one-day
meeting ``the prevention of, and the fight against, sexual
exploitation of children, in particular child pornography requires
concerted action.''
	   They added the smuggling of human beings ``is emerging more and
more frequently as a new and serious form of organized crime.''
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said his country registered
some 17,000 cases of sexual abuse of children in 1997. He estimated
child pornography had a turnover last year of 1.5 billion marks
(almost dlrs 1 billion).
	   Jozef Sestak, Slovakia's deputy foreign minister, said his
country ``has become a transit country for prostitution,
pornography, sex and pedophile tourism.''
	   ``The problem of child prostitution requires a concerted
approach ... with police corps abroad in detecting and recording
child pornography and child sexual abuse for commercial purposes,''
he told the meeting.
	   The European ministers also vowed to boost cooperation in
matters of cross-border pollution from the Arctic Circle to the
Mediterranean.
	   ``We are aware of the international dimension of environmental
issues and the need to further strengthen the cooperation among
participants in this area,'' the ministers said in a joint
statement.
	   The foreign ministers met in the Europe Conference _ a forum the
EU invented in 1997 to bring the EU nations together with all
candidate EU members, plus Turkey. However, Turkey, upset at being
snubbed as a candidate member, has to date boycotted all Europe
Conference meetings.
