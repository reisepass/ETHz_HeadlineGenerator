HANOI, April 19 (Xinhua)-- Vietnam has become the third largest
cashew producer in the world, next only to India and Brazil, with
100,000 tonnes exported last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Vietnam's cashews reaped a total turnover of 100
million U.S. dollars and provided jobs for 15,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese cahsews currently occupy five to 10 percent of the
American market which consumes two-thirds of all cashews grown in
the world.
</P>
<P>
The American company Donafood in southern Vietnam plans to
triple its exports to the U.S. market next year, totalling 50
percent of its planned production.
</P>
<P>
However, the English language daily "Vietnam News " said,
problems remain to temper such optimism.
</P>
<P>
One imperative problem is how to fulfil the export
contracts. The processing companies cannot operate at full
capacity because of a lack of capital and raw material.
</P>
<P>
Weather vagaries can hurt production. Production this year has
decreased remarkably because of the cold and destructive insects.
</P>
<P>
Farmers also suffer losses through intermediaries as they can't
sell their product directly to prcessing companies.
</P>
<P>
Growers claim a proper policy with incentives is needed to tap
Vietnam's current strong potential on the international
market.
