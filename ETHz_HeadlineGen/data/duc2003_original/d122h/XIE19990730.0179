DAR ES SALAAM, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania aims to raise its
cashew nut production to 110,000 tons in this year, the Ministry
of Agriculture and Cooperatives has said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said this in a budget report presented to the
National Assembly earlier this month, Business Times reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the demand of cashew nuts in the world market is
high as Vietnam, one of the leading exporters, has less yields.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's processing plants are running short of raw nuts and
have to buy from other producers like Cote d'Ivoire and
Mozambique, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Traders said that prices of cashew kernels -- processed nuts
removed from their shells, have jumped to 3.2 U.S. dollars per
pound from 2.3 dollar per pound in January this year.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's cashew nut output in 1998/99 (from June 30, 1998 to
July 1, 1999) rose to 105,000 tons from 93,200 tons in the
previous year with the increase of prices of the crop in the world
market.
</P>
<P>
The Cashew Nut Association of Tanzania has said it will make
joint efforts with the government and farmers in raising the
cashew nut output.
</P>
<P>
With funds from the World Bank, Tanzania plans to improve the
processing capacity of the crop in the major growing areas along
the Indian Ocean coastal belt comprising Tanga, Coast, Lindi and
Mtwara regions.
</P>
<P>
The improvement program involves spraying pesticides to treat
"powder mildew" disease at the right time as well as proper crop
husbandry.
</P>
<P>
Cashew nut production has shown marked increase in the past
five years. In 1993/94, output stood at only 46,600 tons.
</P>
<P>
As one of the traditional cash crops, cashew nut is a source of
 livelihood for an estimated 300,000 families, who tend about 30
million trees on 4,000 hectares of land.
