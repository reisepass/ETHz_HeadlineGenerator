	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Satellite operators reported no immediate
problems Tuesday as the Earth passed through the tail of a comet
that peppered the atmosphere with tiny bits of space junk zipping
along at 155,000 mph (250,000 kph).
	   While people around the world watched the beginning of the best
meteor storm light show in three decades, the U.S. National
Aeronautics and Space Administration and private satellite
companies rotated their high-tech machinery to face away from the
approaching debris.
	   The Hubble telescope was turned away from the storm to protect
lens surfaces. And the crew of Russia's Mir space station planned
to wait out the worst of the storm in their emergency escape
vehicle.
	   Most military satellites are built to withstand attack and so
have better protection from the tiny meteors. NASA planned to
reposition six of its 22 satellites to present a smaller target.
Others were to be powered down for the worst part of the storm.
	   The particles from the tail of Comet Tempel-Tuttle move at 43
miles (69 kilometers) per second. Even a small grain can have the
destructive force of a .22-caliber bullet shot at one of the
world's 600-plus satellites, experts say.
	   The debris particles, most no bigger than a grain of sand, can
bore holes in solar panels, damage lenses, blast away mirror
coatings or cause harmful electrical charges.
	   That created a threat to communications, satellite TV broadcasts
and military spying.
	   Aerospace Corp. had no reports of trouble as of early this
morning, said company spokesman Greg Hughes, who was on call
overnight in case of emergency.
	   An office at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,
California, that was to orchestrate troubleshooting efforts
remained unstaffed during the night.
	   The likelihood of a direct hit was small.
	   ``The chances of any one satellite getting smacked by a particle
is probably less than one in one thousand, but on the other hand,
some of these satellites are worth hundreds of millions of dollars,
so you do take whatever precautions you can,'' said Don Yeomans, a
senior research scientist at Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
