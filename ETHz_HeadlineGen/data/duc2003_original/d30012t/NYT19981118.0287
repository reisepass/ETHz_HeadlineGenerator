   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Low pressure will move northeast over the northern Great Lakes
Thursday. A conveyor belt of cold, moist air to the northwest of
the low's track will cause moderate to heavy snow over northern
Minnesota to persist into the afternoon. An additional few inches
of snow will accumulate after sunrise, bringing storm totals to
nearly a foot in some places. Patchy light snow and flurries will
linger over the eastern Dakotas and the rest of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   A cold front extending south from the low will cross the Ohio
and middle Mississippi valleys. Scattered showers and isolated
thunderstorms will precede the front. Given that moist air from the
Gulf of Mexico is limited, heavy rain is unlikely and rainfall
totals will generally remain below one half inch.
</P>
<P>
   Milder air surging north ahead of the front will encounter
stubborn chilly air in the northern Appalachians. As the warm air
is forced to rise above the cooler air near the ground, clouds and
pockets of drizzle will develop over the Northeastern states, aided
by damp air penetrating inland from the Atlantic. Showers will
develop Thursday night as the front approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Although a rogue shower is possible, most of the Southeast will
remain dry through Thursday evening. Florida will be partly sunny
and very warm, with near record warmth in southern sections.
</P>
<P>
   A stream of mild, moist air from the Pacific Ocean will direct
an area of rain onto the Northwest coast with snow falling in the
Cascades. Meanwhile, high pressure over the Great Basin will
sponsor sunny, tranquil conditions from the central Rockies to
southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Eye Protection
</P>
<P>
   For three hours on Tuesday, no images were received from the
satellite that normally provides constant coverage for most of
North America and the Atlantic. Technicians had repositioned the
mirror that is used to make images of the earth so that the
fusillade of tiny particles from the Leonid meteor shower would be
less likely to damage the eye in the sky. There are five
geostationary satellites spaced approximately 70 degrees of
longitude apart that are essential tools for monitoring global
weather changes. All of these satellites came through Tuesday's
meteor shower unscathed.
