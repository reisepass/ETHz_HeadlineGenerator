WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- In a surprise move, U.S.
House prosecutors asked the Senate Tuesday to "request the
appearance" of President Bill Clinton at a deposition for his
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the prosecutors also sought subpoenas to question
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, presidential friend
Vernon Jordan and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors made the request in a motion at the start of
the trial Tuesday, substantially paring down their demand for live
witnesses at the trial. Their motion requested only that the
witnesses be questioned at depositions.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles of
impeachment in connection with his relationship with Lewinsky. The
two articles were approved by the House along partisan lines on
December 19 last year.
</P>
<P>
"The two people who know the most about this are Monica
Lewinsky and President William Jefferson Clinton," Republican
lawmaker Bill McCollum said, adding that the prosecutors "strongly
urge" the Senate to call Clinton to testify without a subpoena.
</P>
<P>
"It is exceedingly important" that the senators have the
opportunity to hear from Clinton himself, McCollum said.
</P>
<P>
The House prosecutors also asked permission to introduce three
pieces of evidence that weren't in the official House impeachment
record used so far during the trial.
