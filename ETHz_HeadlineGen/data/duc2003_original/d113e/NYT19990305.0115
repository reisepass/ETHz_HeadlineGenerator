<P>
   The saga of Bill and Monica is more the stuff of Sidney Sheldon
than William Shakespeare, but Monica Lewinsky's gossipfest with
Barbara Walters nonetheless conjured up some lines from
``Othello'':
</P>
<P>
   ``Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,
</P>
<P>
   ``Nor set down aught in malice: then, must you speak
</P>
<P>
   ``Of one that lov'd not wisely but too well ...''
</P>
<P>
   The operative phrase here is ``lov'd not wisely.''
</P>
<P>
   There can be no doubt after Wednesday's tedious, two-hour
interview on ABC's ``20/20'': Lewinsky was _ maybe still is _ madly
in love with Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during her shabby dalliance with Clinton, Lewinsky
apparently deluded herself into believing that she had a future
with him _ that the 42nd president of the United States might
actually dump his wife and live happily ever after with this giggly
former intern.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewinsky-Clinton ``romance'' began, Monica said, when she
flashed the president a glimpse of her undies to let him know that
``I'm interested ... I'll play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where did you get the nerve?'' Walters wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   Good question. Where did she get the nerve for all of it _
flashing her thong, sneaking in and out of the Oval Office for
sexual encounters, engaging in late-night phone sex with the leader
of the free world?
</P>
<P>
   Where did she get the nerve to gush about the tawdry details in
telephone conversations with her so-called friend Linda Tripp _
conversations that Tripp secretly recorded and eventually turned
over to the president's archenemy, independent counsel Ken Starr?
</P>
<P>
   Where did Lewinsky get the nerve to rehash the scandal in a
tell-all book that hit the store shelves Thursday? Where did she
get the nerve to go over it one more time with Walters?
</P>
<P>
   How, you ask, could anyone be bored by an interview in which the
interviewee explains the concept of phone sex to the interviewer?
How could a lurid tale of sex and lies in the White House be
tedious?
</P>
<P>
   If Hollywood made a movie about all this (starring, let's say,
John Travolta and Jennifer Love Hewitt), wouldn't the public go
wild for it?
</P>
<P>
   Probably. Which only proves that most of the time, fiction is a
lot more interesting than reality.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the Clinton-haters, who saw the scandal as an
exquisite opportunity to demolish his presidency _ and the
Clinton-lovers, who went to war on his behalf _ the public was
bored with ``The Adventures of Bill and Monica'' about 15 minutes
after it opened.
</P>
<P>
   By the time it evolved into the second presidential impeachment
in American history, the scandal had outlived its usefulness for
everyone except the people who were determined to acquire Clinton's
head on a platter _ and, of course, the folks who've been making a
living dissecting the scandal in the media. What will Ann Coulter
and Alan Dershowitz argue about once this story heaves its final
breath?
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky came across as sincere, phony, tortured, silly,
sometimes thoughtful and frequently shallow _ a perfectly normal
concoction of personality traits that told us virtually nothing
about why the president was drawn to her, or vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   She hardly seemed to be the naive woman-child that some had
expected _ hoped? _ she would be. Nor was she the scheming tramp
that others imagined.
</P>
<P>
   She obviously knows that she did something wrong _ but she just
as obviously feels no guilt or remorse about it. Come to think of
it, Monica might well be the Clinton soul mate she imagined herself
to be.
</P>
<P>
   Monica and Bill: two self-deluding, self-absorbed,
self-indulgent brats feeding off each other's arrogance and
insecurity.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky began the interview by apologizing to the nation and to
Clinton's wife and daughter, but it was evident throughout that she
somehow felt entitled to her fling with the president.
</P>
<P>
   This is not someone who suffers from low self-esteem, as she
claims, but rather a person who wants what she wants when she wants
it _ and believes she is special enough to merit such entitlement.
</P>
<P>
   Just like Bill Clinton.
