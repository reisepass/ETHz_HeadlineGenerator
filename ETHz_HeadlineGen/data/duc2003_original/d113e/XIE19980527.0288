WASHINGTON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr has asked Monica Lewinsky to be fingerprinted and to give
voice and handwriting samples in the next few days, news reports
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Starr, who is investigating allegations that President Bill
Clinton had sex with the former White House intern and induced her
to help cover it up, acted under a court order that has existed
since January, the reports quoted legal sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Both Clinton and Lewinsky have denied the allegation under oath.
</P>
<P>
Legal experts said Starr's action could lay the groundwork for
Lewinsky to be called before the grand jury investigating the sex
scandal or set the stage for her indictment on perjury or
obstruction of justice charges.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky, 24, is currently in Los Angeles with her father, Dr.
Bernard Lewinsky, but her spokeswoman, Judy Smith, said Lewinsky
would comply with Starr's order. How and when this will occur is
still being worked out, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
"Ms. Lewinsky has cooperated fully with Starr's investigation
and will appear pursuant to the court order. As we have said since
January 16, she is very anxious to tell her side of the story,"
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
Starr's probe of Lewinsky's relationship with Clinton was
triggered by former Lewinsky co-worker Linda Tripp, who secretly
recorded 20 hours of conversation in which Lewinsky reportedly
told of the White House affair.
