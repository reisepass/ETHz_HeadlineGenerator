WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton, in
a speech to dozens of religious leaders Friday, included Monica
Lewinsky in his statement of regret for having an improper
relationship and lying about it.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is a fancy way to say that I have sinned,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time he had included a direct mention of
Lewinsky, the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to me that everybody who has been hurt know
that the sorrow that I feel is genuine -- first and most important
my family, also my friends, my staff my cabinet, Monica Lewinsky
and her family and the American people.
</P>
<P>
"I have asked all for their forgiveness. But I believe to be
forgiven, more than sorrow is required," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said he had a broken spirit but hope that he
could redeem the nation's trust.
</P>
<P>
"If my repentance is genuine and sustained, and if I can
maintain both a broken spirit and a strong heart then good can
come of this for our country as well as for me and my family," he
said.
