WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Monica Lewinsky has been given
full immunity in exchange for testimony in Kenneth Starr's
six-month investigation of her relationship with President Bill
Clinton, Lewinsky's attorneys said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We, as counsel for Monica Lewinsky, have reached an agreement
today that for her full and truthful testimony she will receive
transactional immunity in this case," said Plato Cacheris, one of
her attorneys.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky's mother, Marcia Lewis, was granted the same level of
protection from prosecution, said her attorney, Billy Martin. The
mother had frequent telephone conversations with her daughter
about Lewinsky's relationship with Clinton, according to 20 hours
of tape recordings between Ms. Lewinsky and former friend Linda
Tripp.

After talking to prosecutors for five hours in New York on
Monday, Lewinsky has agreed to testify that she had a sexual
relationship with the president, The Associated Press quoted legal
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Her lawyer said that she's going to give complete and truthful
testimony, and if she does, that should present no problem to the
president, obviously," White House spokesman Mike McCurry said. "I
think he's pleased that things will work out for her." Clinton
talked with his lawyer, David Kendall, earlier Tuesday, McCurry
said.

<P>
Transactional immunity means that Lewinsky will not be
prosecuted for any testimony that she gives to Starr's office
regarding matters under investigation. It is the most protective
type of immunity that can be granted to a witness.
</P>
<P>
The source said the earlier proffer contained "a fair amount of
information" dealing with Lewinsky's conversations with the
president and his confidants about how they would deal with Mrs.
Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton. The president
denied under oath in the Jones case that he'd had sexual relations
with Lewinsky and she filed an affidavit in the suit saying "I
have never had a sexual relationship with the president."
