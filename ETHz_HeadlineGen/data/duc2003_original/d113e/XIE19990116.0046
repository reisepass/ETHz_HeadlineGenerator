WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House prosecutor Bill
McCollum told senators in President Bill Clinton's impeachment
trial Friday that former White House intern Monica Lewinsky's
testimony establishes that Clinton "knowingly, intentionally"
sought to obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
"If you believe the testimony of Monica Lewinsky, you cannot
believe the president or accept the argument of his lawyers,"
McCollum said in a summary of evidence on behalf of the 13 House
prosecutors on the second day of their presentation.
</P>
<P>
McCollum, a Republican lawmaker, encouraged the senators to
view the case against Clinton as "one big obstruction" in which
the president "thought his scheme out well" in an effort to
conceal his affair with Lewinsky from the court overseeing the
Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
"If you believe the sworn testimony of Monica Lewinsky, if you
believe her testimony that's in the record -- and she's very
credible -- the president knowingly, intentionally and willfully
set out on a course of conduct in December 1997 to lie to the
Jones court, to hide his relationship and to encourage others to
lie and hide evidence," McCollum said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in
two articles of impeachment approved on December 19 last year by
the House along partisan lines.
</P>
<P>
Senators returned to the Capitol Friday for more evidence and
arguments from House prosecutors, still mostly divided along party
lines on the crucial issues of calling trial witnesses and whether
Clinton should be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle said Clinton wouldn't come
to testify, and he called Republican suggestions that Clinton do
so "a non-issue."
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the president, who left
Washington Friday for a trip to New York, got a 10-15 minute
"rundown" from his lawyers Thursday night on developments in the
trial's first day.
</P>
<P>
"There's no testimony that proves the president committed
perjury. There's no testimony that proves the president obstructed
justice. In fact there is direct testimony to the contrary,"
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is the second president in U.S. history to be subjected
to a trial, after Andrew Johnson in 1868. It takes a two-thirds
vote in the Senate to remove the president from office, meaning a
dozen Democrats would have to join the 55 Republicans to convict
him.
