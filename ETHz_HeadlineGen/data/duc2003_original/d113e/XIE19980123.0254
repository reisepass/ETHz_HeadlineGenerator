WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The former White House
intern, Monica Lewinsky, received an indefinite reprieve in having
to decide whether to stand by her earlier assertion in an
affidavit that she did not have an affair with U.S. President Bill
Clinton, take the Fifth Amendment or change her story.
</P>
<P>
A federal judge in Little Rock, Arkansas where Clinton was once
governor, postponed a deposition that had been scheduled Friday
for Lewinsky, 24, to testify in Paula Jones' sexual harassment
lawsuit against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky remained secluded, telling CBS News by phone that she
had no comment.
</P>
<P>
"The deposition of Monica Lewinsky has been indefinitely
continued," U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright wrote in a
one-line statement.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday Clinton again made a firm denial to Ms. Lewinksy's
claims in taped conversations with a friend that she had an affair
with Clinton and that he and his friend Vernon Jordan asked her to
deny it to Jones' attorneys.
</P>
<P>
"The allegations are false, and I would never ask anybody to do
anything other than tell the truth," Clinton said. Lewinsky
herself has denied the claims she made in tape-recorded
conversations with her friend Linda Tripp, a former White House
staffer.
</P>
<P>
Jordan added to the denials at a press conference Thursday
afternoon, "I want to say to you absolutely and unequivocally that
Ms. Lewinsky told me in no uncertain terms that she did not have a
sexual relationship with the president."
