WASHINGTON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Broadcast across the world
Saturday from the well of the U.S. Senate, former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky recounted via videotape her story of a
presidential affair and cover-up to Americans seeing her testify
for the first time and to senators who must decide the fate of
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
House prosecutors juxtaposed the image of Lewinsky, dressed in
a dark dress, her hand raised to tell the truth, with the
now-famous footage of the January 1998 news conference in which
Clinton denied sexual relations with "that woman, Ms. Lewinsky."
</P>
<P>
House prosecutor James Rogan implored senators to listen to "a
bright lady whose life has forever been marked by the most
powerful man on earth."
</P>
<P>
"If her testimony is truthful, then the president committed the
offenses in the articles of impeachment," Rogan added, calling
today's extraordinary session at the impeachment trial the "first
and only chance'' to hear from witnesses with "direct knowledge of
the unlawful conduct of the president of the United States."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles of
impeachment in connection with his relationship with Lewinsky. The
two articles were approved by the House along partisan lines on
December 19 last year.
</P>
<P>
The Senate is expected to vote on the two articles of
impeachment against Clinton on February 12. A two-thirds vote is
needed to convict the president and remove him from office. No one
believes there are enough votes in the Senate to remove Clinton.
