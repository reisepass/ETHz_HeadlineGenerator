	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Eleven of the European Union's 15
members soldered their moneys into a single currency Thursday, but
that act of monetary union also had consequences for such diverse
places as Monaco, the Vatican and the islands of St. Pierre and
Miquelon off the coast of Canada.
	   The Vatican and the Republic of San Marino are microstates
located wholly within Italy and use the Italian lira as their
currency.
	   Monaco is a tiny principality on France's Mediterranean coast.
St. Pierre and Miquelon, minuscule islands off Newfoundland, are
part of France's far-flung territories, as is the Indian Ocean
island of Mayotte. All use the French franc as their currency.
	   Italy and France have adopted the euro, as the European Union's
new single currency is known. That leaves these various tiny
places, all non-members of the EU, without a money of their own
unless they make special arrangements to adopt the euro.
	   EU finance ministers, who fixed the exchange rates between the
euro and the national currencies of the 11 as the final step before
creating the new currency at midnight, said the tiny countries and
territories could use the single European currency under certain
conditions.
	   The ministers ruled that San Marino, the Vatican and Monaco will
be entitled to use the euro as their official currency, but they
will not be allowed to issue any banknotes or coins unless they
agreed to conditions imposed by the EU.
	   Euro notes and coins, which will be put into circulation in
2002, will feature bridges, windows and doorways in various
European styles. Euros stamped with a likeness of the pope, for
example, would be certain to arouse strong opposition among some
segments of the European population.
	   Italy was designated to begin negotiations with San Marino and
the Vatican over their use and eventual issuance of euro currency.
France was tapped to negotiate an agreement with Monaco.
	   ``Vatican City will have the right to continue issuing collector
coins and the Republic of San Marino to continue using gold coins
denominated in scudi,'' the ministers said.
	   Those three also will be required to adopt EU rules on currency
and to ``cooperate closely with the community with regard to
measures against counterfeiting of euro banknotes and coins.''
	   With regard to the two French territories, the ministers decided
that the euro would be their currency two and that France would
continue to grant legal status to their banknotes and coins.
	   France will be required to pass national legislation putting
these monetary arrangements into law.
