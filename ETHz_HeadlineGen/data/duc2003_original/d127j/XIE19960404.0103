LONDON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- British Board of Trade president
Ian Lang Wednesday warned that a single European currency could
prove harmful to British business if adopted without full and
careful consideration of possible consequences.
</P>
<P>
The British government would not allow other European
governments to use the threat of trade sanctions to bully Britain
into signing up for a single currency, Lang told a forum on
European policy.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed the claim made by Jacques Santer, president of the
European Commission, that any delay in achieving European Monetary
Union by the target date of January 1, 1999, would undermine the
internal market.
</P>
<P>
"Let me be clear: the success of the single market does not
require a single currency," he told his audience, noting that
there had been no mention of a single currency in the Commission's
blueprint for a single market and that it was working well at
present without one.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that with the introduction of a single currency,
there would be a temptation to expand the provision of structural
funds to meet pleas for help. The burden would fall on countries
like Britain which are major contributors to the community.
</P>
<P>
The result would be higher levels of public spending and higher
taxes, which would impose additional burdens on British companies
and individuals.
</P>
<P>
Lang conceded that a single currency would benefit businesses,
at least for those operating in Europe.
</P>
<P>
However, innovation in banking was helping to reduce
transaction costs, making it easier and cheaper for business to
deal in different currencies, he said.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that "making sure our interests are fully secured
is not the policy of anti-Europeanism, but the politics of common
sense."
