ROME, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
and French President Jaques Chirac today reached a consensus on
the timetable for the launch of the single European currency at
summit talks in southern Italian city of Naples.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the single European currency must be launched
at the beginning of 1999 and the timetable should not be changed
unless there appear unexpected incidents.
</P>
<P>
The consensus will help iron out the differences between the
two countries triggered by Chirac's criticism earlier this week of
the unstable lira and his questioning whether Italy could qualify
as a founder of a single European currency.
</P>
<P>
Chirac and Prodi discussed the lira's return to the European
exchange rate mechanism (ERM), the single European currency due to
be launched in 1999, the reform of EU institutions and the
Schengen accord on closer cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Prodi insisted that Italy wanted the lira
to rejoin the European exchange rate mechanism as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The lira dropped out of the ERM in a European currency crisis
in 1992, and has devalued considerably since then.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference after the summit, Chirac said France
and Italy employed "practically identical approaches" on all
issues.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also exchanged views on bilateral relations, the
situation in Middle East and the former Yugoslavia and other
issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
They called on the conflicting parties in the bloody clashes
between the Israelis and Palestinians to refrain themselves and to
continue the peace process in the region.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said that the meeting is of great significance to both
Italy and France and the cooperation between the two countries
could contribute not only to the economic development of Europe
but also to the world situation.
