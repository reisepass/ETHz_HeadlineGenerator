ROME, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Italian leaders said today that there
was more to Europe than the single European currency -- the goal
of the long process of European integration was a political
government and a political parliament.
</P>
<P>
Italian President Oscar Scalfaro said a political government
and a political parliament was "absolutely essential if Europe is
to be what we have dreamed." He was meeting Italy's members of the
European Parliament (MEPs) on the eve of Europe Day.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro told the MEPs that "the power of geography will
certainly triumph over all the uncertainties and questions."
</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said the blueprint drawn
in the Maastricht Treaty for European Union was not limited to the
single currency, and must be completed in its full vision.
</P>
<P>
Dini said the inter-governmental conference (IGC) to revise the
treaty was the last chance to respect objectives and timetables.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that for Italy, it was necessary to
develop the aspects of European union: political, social, civil
and security. Otherwise, there would be the risk of creating an
unstable and incomplete Europe, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the single currency, the euro, was "certainly a central
element" in achieving full European integration.
</P>
<P>
However: "The overall design is much more comprehensive and
vast because it is a union of currencies and peoples, producers
and citizens, economic development and political growth, freedom
and security."
