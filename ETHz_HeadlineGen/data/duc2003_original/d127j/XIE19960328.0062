LONDON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- British officials will fight
suggestions that UK be forced to enter a new European exchange
rate mechanism (ERM) after the proposed European single currency
comes into force, it was reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Some continental countries are stepping up their demands that
countries, including Britain, should be forced to link their
currencies to the Euro, the future European single currency
planned to be issued by January 1999.
</P>
<P>
At a bilateral meeting Tuesday focusing on the issue, French
and German officials agreed that a new ERM would be needed.
</P>
<P>
The two countries fear that without a new exchange rate target
to link currencies to the Euro, currencies outside the future
single currency would devalue.
</P>
<P>
Britain, which pulled out of the mechanism in 1992, however, is
vehemently opposed to the idea, arguing that ERM structure might
be useful for other countries, but not for UK.
</P>
<P>
Instead, British officials are calling for a strict European
inflation control system under which countries outside future
single currency would be required to adhere to a tight inflation
target, probably less than two percent.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that this is enforced, their policies for meeting the
target would be monitored by other countries and the European
Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
Britain argues that the inflation target would prevent the
devaluation of the currencies outside the single currency.
</P>
<P>
It is believed, however, that the UK argument is unlikely
to satisfy most of the other European countries and a fierce
debate is expected when European finance ministers meet in
Verona, Italy, next month.
