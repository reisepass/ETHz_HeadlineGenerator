PARIS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Declaring that "Currency is
politics," French Prime Minister Alain Juppe today reiterated
France's determination to realize the single European currency.
</P>
<P>
"The economic and monetary union is neither a technical issue,
nor an economic demand," Juppe noted at a debate on the European
economic and monetary union in the National Assembly. "It is
firstly and mainly a political plan for us."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that such a political plan concerns the future
of France and Germany, as well as the future role which the
European countries will play in the world.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the introduction of a single currency will be a
great contribution to the unity of an expanded European Union (EU),
Juppe reiterated France's commitment to the timetable and criteria
of the single currency system set in the Maastricht treaty, under
which the single European currency, recently named Euro, will be
realized by January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
At present, qualms about a single currency still exist in
France and many other EU member countries as some economists fear
that a single currency means a country's loss of financial
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Many people worry that the tough budgetary criteria for the
single currency will cause rising unemployment and worsening
social welfare.
</P>
<P>
In view of these confusions, Juppe gave a clear-cut answer by
saying in the speech that only a single currency can guarantee
currency stability, which means "lower interest rates, sustained
economic growth and good prospects of employment."
</P>
<P>
Juppe demanded French leaders make efforts to eliminate the
confusions.
