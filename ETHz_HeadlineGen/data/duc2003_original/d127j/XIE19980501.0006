BRUSSELS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Parliament approved
on Thursday the European Commission's recommendation for 11
countries to join the single currency mechanism in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
The European legislators voted 402-79 with 27 abstentions to
approve the recommendation made on March 25.
</P>
<P>
The European Council of finance ministers and the European
Union Summit members -- scheduled to meet this weekend -- are the
institutions to give their final approval.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, recommended that Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland,
Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Finland
be the founding countries of the single currency, known as the
euro.
</P>
<P>
The four other EU member states remain outside the first wave
of the single currency launch.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Denmark opted out on their own, while Sweden and
Greece were judged by the commission to be not economically ready
to join.
</P>
<P>
European legislators also advised on Thursday that the weekend
summit must decide on a single candidate to preside over the
future European Central Bank (ECB).
</P>
<P>
They also urged Belgium and Italy to make more efforts to
reduce their high public debts.
</P>
<P>
The European Union suggested that countries aspiring to join
the single currency system should have a debt to gross domestic
product ratio of less than 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Belgium and Italy, however, still have 122.2 percent and 121.6
percent respectively of the debt-to-GDP ratio and have been the
center of argument on whether they are fit to be on board.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands is backing the bid by the current head of the
European Monetary Institute, Wim Duisenberg, to head the future
ECB, whereas France is championing its own central banker
Jean-Claude Trichet to be the ECB president.
