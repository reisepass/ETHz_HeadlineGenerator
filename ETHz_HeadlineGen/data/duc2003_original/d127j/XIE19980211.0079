BRUSSELS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Brushing aside simmering
opposition to European monetary union, a senior executive of the
European Union claimed Wednesday that the single currency is
gaining credibility.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the credibility of the euro is being
undermined, but it is gaining credibility all the time,"
Yves-Thibault de Silguy, European commissioner for economic,
monetary and financial affairs, told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He was explaining a commission report published Wednesday on
the practical aspects of the introduction of the single currency,
to be known as the euro.
</P>
<P>
The report covered three areas where decisions are expected to
be made during a February 26 round-table conference by
representatives of professional and consumer groups.
</P>
<P>
It also summarized the conclusions of the five working groups
established to examine specific aspects of the transition to the
euro following an earlier round-table meeting last May.
</P>
<P>
The undecided areas are how long parallel circulation is to
last with euro notes and coins alongside national currencies, how
dual pricing would affect display of values in euros and national
currencies and how much banks should charge converting national
currencies into euros.
</P>
<P>
De Silguy said the key to these decisions is transparency and
competition.
</P>
<P>
Taking account of the conclusions of the February 26
round-table meeting, the European Commission intends to make
recommendations to the Council of Ministers with a view to
securing final conclusions on all outstanding issues by May 2. On
that date the initial list of countries to participate in the
European Monetary Union (EMU) will be announced, he said.
</P>
<P>
"May 2 will be the decision day when all practical instructions
on the euro will be published," said de Silguy.
</P>
<P>
Asked about opposition to the EMU raised by 155 German
economics scholars, the commissionor said people should not be
carried away by opposing opinions.
</P>
<P>
There were always pros and cons and that was the way life was
supposed to be, he said.
</P>
<P>
The German group of economists has written a letter to the
European Commission opposing the launch on January 1, next year,
of the single currency, arguing that the conditions are simply not
right.
</P>
<P>
In another development, 130 Dutch scholars also appealed for a
postponement of the euro launch.
</P>
<P>
But de Silguy said one thing was certain and that was the
single currency would be inaugurated on time.
</P>
<P>
What was uncertain now, however, was how many countries would
be in the first wave joining the single currency mechanism, he
said.
