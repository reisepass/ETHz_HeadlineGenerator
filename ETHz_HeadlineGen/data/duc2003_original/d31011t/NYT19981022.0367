   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Snow advisories were issued Thursday for the San Juan Mountains
in southeast Colorado as moist air drawn northward by a distant
upper-level low-pressure system over northern Nevada was forced to
ascend the sloping terrain. On Friday, the upper-level low will
weaken as it migrates slowly into western Montana, touching off
scattered showers in the northern Rockies and northern Great Basin.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, isolated showers and a few thunderstorms will
develop over the southern Rockies in Arizona, New Mexico and
western Colorado as residual moist air left in the wake of the
Montana low is lifted over the mountainous terrain.
</P>
<P>
   A chilly, frosty morning over the middle Mississippi and Ohio
valleys will be followed by a sunny, mild afternoon under the
auspices of a sprawling high- pressure system centered over
southeast Missouri. The clockwise circulation of air around the
behemoth high will stretch from New England to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Along Florida's east coast, ocean winds averaging 15 to 30 mph
will pile up water at spots along beaches, raising the risk that
dangerous rip currents will develop. Gusts to 40 mph are possible
in spots. Meanwhile, widely separated showers and thunderstorms
will form over the peninsula, fueled by inbound ocean moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Across New England, winds from the west will send milder air
eastward from the Great Lakes. However, a warm front marking the
leading edge of the advancing milder air will meet with some
resistance, paving the way for spotty showers across northern New
England.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Stormy Philippines
</P>
<P>
   Supertyphoon Babs, armed with winds over 150 mph, slammed into
the Philippine island of Luzon on Wednesday. The fierce landfall
followed on the heels of Supertyphoon Zeb, which lashed Luzon over
a week ago. The long north-to-south span of the Philippines places
the chain squarely within the main migration route of typhoons in
the western Pacific, which boasts a higher frequency of tropical
storms than any other basin in the world. The primary reasons for
the high frequency of storms are the large expanse of very warm
water and favorably steady upper-level winds from the east.
