	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada on Thursday
donated 600,000 pesos (dlrs 15,000), the equivalent of his salary
for one year, to a fund for victims of recent typhoons in the
Philippines, the presidential palace said.
	   Estrada gave the money to start off a fund-raising campaign, and
asked other Filipinos to help.
	   At least two Chinese-Filipino associations immediately donated 3
million pesos (dlrs 75,000), the palace said.
	   Estrada also ordered officials of the government-run national
sweepstakes office to set up six special lotteries and donate the
proceeds to victims of the four typhoons that have ravaged the
country since September. The storms left at least 370 people dead,
more than 200,000 others homeless and millions of dollars worth of
crops and property destroyed.
	   On Wednesday, the Philippine Red Cross sought help from its
international counterparts for the victims. The international Red
Cross said it is launching an appeal for 3 million Swiss francs
(about dlrs 2.2 million) ``in urgent humanitarian assistance.''
	   The last time the Philippine Red Cross sought international help
was in 1995, when Typhoon Angela devastated the northern
Philippines. It also requested help following the eruption of Mount
Pinatubo in June 1991, and when a flash flood killed more than
6,000 people in central Ormoc City in November that year.
	   The typhoons damaged or destroyed 10.4 billion pesos (dlrs 252.8
million) worth of infrastructure, crops and other property,
according to the civil defense office.
