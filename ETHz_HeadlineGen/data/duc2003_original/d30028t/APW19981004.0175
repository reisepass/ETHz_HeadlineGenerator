	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Signaling it does not want to be involved in
any potential military confrontation between Syria and Turkey,
Israel is limiting routine exercises along its own border with
Syria.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also stressed Israel's
hands-off approach to the escalating dispute between Damascus and
Ankara.
	   ``We have no part in this tension,'' Netanyahu told reporters in
Jerusalem on Sunday. ``We have taken steps to reassure Syria.''
	   Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai instructed the army to limit
military maneuvers along Israel's border with Syria to avoid giving
any impression Israel is poised to act.
	   ``Israel is not interested in confrontation with Syria, but
rather in finding ways to renew talks,'' Mordechai's office quoted
him Sunday as saying.
