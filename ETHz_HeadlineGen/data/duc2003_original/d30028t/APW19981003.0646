	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel is not involved in any way in the
current, growing confrontations between Turkey and Syria, a
spokesman said Saturday.
	   ``Israel is not a part of this dispute and is not involved in it
in any way,'' said Defense Ministry spokesman Avi Benayahu.
	   Turkey has amassed troops on the border with Syria and warned of
a military confrontation following allegations that Syria is
supporting Turkish Kurdish rebels.
	   Damascus in respoonse has accused Turkey and Israel of
contriving against Syria through their increased military
cooperation.
	   Israel and Turkey signed military accords in 1996 that outline
joint defense maneuvers and grant Israel the use of Turkish air
space.
	   Israeli experts say they doubt the relations with Turkey are
such that either army would defend the other in the event of
confrontations with a third party.
