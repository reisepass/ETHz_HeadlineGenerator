YICHANG, September 4 (Xinhua) -- China will lock the main
stream of the Yangtze River at the Three Gorges in early November,
announced Lu Youmei, general manager of China Yangtze Three Gorges
Project Development Corporation.
</P>
<P>
"Normally, the damming a river might be done in a dry season,
which falls between late January and late February each year, with
reduced water flow and drop that helps to alleviate the difficulty
of locking," said Lu, also deputy head of Three Gorges Project
Construction Committee under the State Council, the country's
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
"But to lock the Yangtze at the Three Gorges, it is necessary
not only to take water flow and drop into account, but also to
remember that after the locking, there should be enough time to
build two cofferdams to required heights before next May, when the
flood season of 1998 begins," Lu stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, it would have catastrophic consequences on the
construction of the entire Three Gorges Dam Project," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges project, which began in December of 1994, is
situated on the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and is a major
part of China's effort to develop its longest river.
</P>
<P>
It will help prevent flooding along the Yangtze, and its
annual power output will reach 84.7 billion kwh. The entire
Three Gorges water control dam project will take 17 years to
complete.
