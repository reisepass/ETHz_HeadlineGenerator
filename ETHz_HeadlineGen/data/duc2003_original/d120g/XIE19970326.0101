CHONGQING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Installation of a 176-km-long
power transmission line from Changshou County of Sichuan Province
to Wanxian City of Chongqing, China's youngest municipality,
started today.
</P>
<P>
The transmission line is but the first of many power
transmission projects for the gigantic water control dam now under
construction at the Three Gorges on the middle reaches of the
Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The power transmission project, together with the dam itself
and the related resettlement work, have been considered as three
key jobs to be done for the construction of the Three Gorges Dam
Project.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua sent a letter of congratulations for
the ground-breaking event. In his letter, Zou claimed that China
would have a power grid connecting ten provinces and cities in
east, central, and west China in the forthcoming ten years, with
the Three Gorges Project as a central link, which would produce
great impact on China's national economy and social development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at today's ceremony for the ground-breaking event, Guo
Shuyan, director of the Three Gorges Project Office of the State
Council, said the entire power transmission project of the Three
Gorges project will require the construction of over 80 separate
power transmission facilities and will cost a total of 27.5
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Installation of Changshou-Wanxian power transmission line is
scheduled to be finished in May of next year, while the Three
Gorges Dam-Wangxian-Changshou-Chongqing power transmission project
be completed in 2002.
</P>
<P>
The State Power Grid Development Co. Ltd, which is responsible
for the construction of the Three Gorges power transmission
project, will practice a range of effective measures, including
corporate liability, contracting projects through public bids,
project supervision and contract management, to ensure complete
success of the Three Gorges project.
