WUHAN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- GSM (Global System of Mobile
Communications) went into service Thursday at the construction
site of China's biggest water control project -- the Three Gorges
Dam.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Hubei Province Mobile Telecommunications
Company, the developer of GSM service, said the base stations of
the GSM in the Three Gorges Dam area are capable of handling phone
calls simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
The construction site of the Three Gorges Dam covers an area of
15.28 sq km. Previously, contacts among design organizations,
construction companies and equipment suppliers were limited, as
the project developer, the Yangtze River Three Gorges Project
Development Corporation, practiced closed management at the
construction site, causing the telecommunications signals in the
area to be weak.
</P>
<P>
There were also no China Telecom base stations there.
</P>
<P>
The Hubei Province Mobile Telecommunications Company spent 40
million yuan to bring GSM service to the construction site of the
gigantic water control project on the middle reaches of the
Yangtze River, China's longest, in early April. Workers completed
the construction in just four months.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xugui, an official with the Engineering Department of the
Yangtze River Three Gorges Project Development Corporation, said
that he believed the improved telecommunications conditions will
not only provide a powerful guarantee for ensuring the successful
completion of the dam, but also promote the development of tourism
in the Three Gorges area.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that his company will cooperate with the China
Mobile Group in the near future and invest 100 million yuan in
erecting a permanent mobile telecommunications network that will
cover the entire Three Gorges Reservoir area.
