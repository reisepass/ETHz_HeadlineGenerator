BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper, the
People's Daily, will carry an editorial on Monday highlighting the
relocation project in the Three Gorges area in central China,
where the country is building a gigantic dam and the world's
largest hydropower and water conservancy project.
</P>
<P>
"The building of the Three Gorges Dam, a super-large project at
the turn of the century, is of historic significance in our
country's modernization drive. The relocation effort associated
with the dam area is a key to the success of the project," says
the article, titled "Ensure the Smooth Development of the Three
Gorges Second-phase Relocation Project."
</P>
<P>
Some one-million people must be moved out of the Three Gorges
area to make way for the dam, scheduled to be completed early next
century.
</P>
<P>
"The Three Gorges relocation project, which involves 22
counties and districts in Hubei Province and Chongqing
Municipality, is unprecedented both in China and the rest of the
world. Both the Party and the government have attached the utmost
importance to it," the article says.
</P>
<P>
It hails the convocation of a two-day national conference on
the Three Gorges relocation project in Beijing last week as a "
significant event" which will have a major impact on the second-
phase relocation.
</P>
<P>
According to information from the conference, more than 100,000
residents in a dozen cities and towns to be submerged once the
Three Gorges Dam is completed have been moved out of the area in
the past six years, and most of the local enterprises have been
either closed up or moved to other places.
