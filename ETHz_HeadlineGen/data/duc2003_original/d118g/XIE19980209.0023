NAKURU, Kenya, February 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. special envoy Jesse
Jackson called Sunday on the Kenyan government to halt tribal
conflicts in which some 120 people have been killed and hundreds
brutally injured since January 11.
</P>
<P>
"The government must bring the order back and stop the
violence," he said after touring three hospitals hosting clash
victims in Nakuru of the Rift Valley Province. The town is an
epicenter of the clashes shocking the whole east African state.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi should exert an influence
immediately on stopping the continuous bloodshed tragedies which
has also scared foreign investors away, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"It's the healing time. (Let) people alive... One Kenya, One
people!" he repeatedly and loudly appealed to the crowd, urging
all Kenyans to choose reconciliation instead of retaliation so as
to fight the poverty and build up the country together.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he noted the country's second multi-party general
election, despite its all flaws and related disturbance, went
through basically in a democratic manner.
</P>
<P>
As U.S. President Bill Clinton's special envoy for the
promotion of democracy in Africa, Jackson is expected to hold
talks with Moi Monday, the second day of his two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Jackson was scheduled to visit the Democratic Republic of
Congo and Liberia afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Local press said Jackson's visits are part of the U.S.
attempts to end violence and improve human rights which the U.S.
administration lists as keys for these nations to attract foreign
investment and get sustainable economic growth.
