JOHANNESBURG, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The South African Truth and
 Reconciliation Commission (TRC) has completely failed to
address or find the root causes for black-on-black violence which
has claimed more than 30, 000 lives in this country, Home Affairs
Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the African Renaissance Festival in Durban on the
conflict challenge facing Africa, Buthelezi said the TRC had
achieved some success in investigating and portraying
white-on-black violence and black-on-white violence.
</P>
<P>
Only time would tell if they had been successful in
reconciling these two groups, he was quoted by South African Press
Association as saying.
</P>
<P>
"However, in respect of black-on-black violence neither truth
nor reconciliation has been achieved," he said, adding that "the
TRC has not even begun to scratch the surface of black-on-black
violence," Buthelezi said.
</P>
<P>
The TRC has undergone major setbacks in the research and
understanding of the root causes and dynamics of black-on-black
violence, Buthelezi said.
</P>
<P>
Some 30,000 people were killed in black-on-black violence and
hundreds of thousands were displaced during the anti-apartheid
struggle. In contrast only 600 whites were killed.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that we are far from exposing the picture of what
really happened in our country," Buthelezi said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, African National Congress leader in KwaZulu-Natal
Province, S'bu Ndebele, said people of Africa were not in
conflict with the rest of world but "in conflict with people of
Africa".
</P>
<P>
He said violence in KwaZulu-Natal, in which thousands have
died in the past 15 years, could be solved through cooperation by
the political parties -- as was currently being done.
