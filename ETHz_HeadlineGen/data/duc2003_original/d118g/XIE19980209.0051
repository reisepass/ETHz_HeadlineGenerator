Nairobi, February 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. special envoy Jesse
Jackson urged Monday Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi during
their talks to visit Rift Valley Province in a bid to end tribal
clashes there killing some 120 people since January 11.
</P>
<P>
"The president's presence, personal presence and touch, will
show a humane expression of care across lines, party, ethnic
lines," said Jackson, U.S. President Bill Clinton's envoy for
democracy in Africa, following a morning meeting with Moi.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters following a morning meeting with Moi that he
believes Moi might visit the violent province as early as this
week.
</P>
<P>
He said that a joint visit by Moi and opposition leader Mwai
Kibaki would provide a useful symbol of ethnic and political
unity of the eastern African country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he noted that "the United States is deeply
concerned by the outbreaks of ethnically-based violence in the
Rift Valley in recent weeks."
</P>
<P>
His two-day visit starting Sunday "reflects the importance the
U.S. attaches to the continued development of democracy in
Kenya," Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
Four people were seriously wounded and 17 houses were burned
out when raiders attacked Lorian Saturday night, forcing hundreds
of scared families to flee the area.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Kenya African National Union and the opposition
accuse each other of inciting violence mainly between the largest
Kenyan tribe of Kikuyu and Moi's home tribe Kalenjin.
</P>
<P>
Local press said many of the early victims of the violence
appeared to be Kikuyus, but that Kalenjin people now turned out
to account for half of the dead.
</P>
<P>
Jackson toured three hospitals hosting clash victims in Nakuru
of the Rift Valley Province Sunday. The town is an epicenter of
the clashes shocking the whole east African state.
</P>
<P>
He left here this afternoon for the Democratic Republic of
Congo and Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Local press say his visits are part of preparations for
Clinton's visit to Africa due in March.
