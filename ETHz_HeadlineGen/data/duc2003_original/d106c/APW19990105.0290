	NEW YORK (AP) -- Under the new bowl coalition format that crowned  
a clear-cut national champion, more people were expected to watch 
the 1999 Fiesta Bowl title game. That didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee's national championship victory in the Fiesta Bowl was  
watched in more than 17 million homes, for a 17.2 national rating. 
Even though two games had national title implications last year, 
the Rose Bowl still managed a higher (17.6) rating. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the 1998 Rose Bowl featured Michigan winning a  
last-second thriller over Washington State while the Orange Bowl 
pitted Nebraska against Tennessee and grabbed a 13.3 rating. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolverines and Cornhuskers finished the season with a share  
of the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's contest was a yawner for much of the game, until the  
final minutes when Florida State cut the deficit to seven points. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expected the Fiesta Bowl would do a pretty good number, but  
I thought it would be better than that,'' said ABC analyst Todd 
Blackledge, who worked the Fiesta Bowl on Monday night. ``One of 
the factors may have been that both teams were from the southeast, 
so it was kind of a regional game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new format, four bowl games comprise the Bowl  
Championship Series -- Fiesta, Rose, Orange and Sugar. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining three bowls actually fared better than last  
season's No. 2, 3 and 4 games. 
</P>
<P>
	What was even more impressive was that it was done without top  
draws Notre Dame, Michigan and Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
	``The BCS has had a positive impact on TV ratings,'' ABC  
spokesman Mark Mandel said. ``But the bigger picture of all of this 
is that it crowned a national champion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This season's Rose Bowl, a shootout won by Wisconsin over UCLA,  
posted a 13.6 rating, which was 2 percent higher than the 1998 
Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 Sugar Bowl, in which Ohio State won easily over Texas  
A&AMP;M, had a 11.5 rating -- an increase of 3 percent from last year's 
game between Ohio State and Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orange Bowl this year was the lowest-rated of the BCS bowls,  
a 8.4 rating. That was still well ahead of the either the Cotton 
(6.2) or Fiesta (5.8) in 1998.
