   PASADENA _ TheP'J{c3H &QR;  R-Z,Z %-MQ its first national
championship football game for the Bowl Championship Series in
2002, will again host the game in 2006 as part of a $122-million
television package, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally a game that pits the champions of the Pac-10 and
Big Ten conferences, the Rose Bowl is quickly becoming the
centerpiece of the BCS. To that end, Tournament of Roses and ABC
television officials have agreed to a $122-million package that
culminates in 2006 the same year the TofR will have its first woman
president, Libby Evans-Wright.
</P>
<P>
   The money, to be paid in installments beginning in 2002, will be
split between the Pac-10 and Big Ten conferences, said Harriman
Cronk, head of the TofR's football committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The letters are in the process of being signed,'' Cronk said.
``They are in the form of a proposal to extend the Rose Bowl's
agreement with the BCS and ABC.''
</P>
<P>
   The current deal, which guaranteed about $19 million to the
conferences, would have expired in 2002. The TofR had an option to
extend through 2006 and its choice of years between 2003 and 2006
in which to host a second BCS championship.
</P>
<P>
   ABC officials in New York did not return phone calls Friday
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS promises to match the No. 1 and No. 2 college football
teams in the country in a national championship game. The game
rotates each year between the Fiesta Bowl in Tempe, Ariz.; the
Sugar Bowl in New Orleans; the Orange Bowl in Miami and the Rose
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The 2001 game will be held in Miami. Pasadena gets its shot in
2002. It will be a first for the Rose Bowl game, which has pitted
the champions of the Pac-10 and Big Ten annually since 1947.
</P>
<P>
   For extending the BCS contract, the Pac-10 and Big Ten will get
$20.5 million from ABC for the 2002 game, $24 million in 2003, $25
million in 2004, $26 million in 2005 and $27 million in 2006, Cronk
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Extending the contract out through 2006 will give us another
national championship,'' Cronk said. ``I'm excited about that. The
BCS has been very successful and I'm very excited about bringing
teams here that have never played in Pasadena.''
