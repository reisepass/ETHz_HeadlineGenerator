   There's a new poll, a new No. 1 and some new math for
gridiron-ologists to digest as college football marches on to the
bowl season and, presumably an undisputed national champion. The
Bowl Championship Series has released its first ranking and the
UCLA Bruins are on top.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Ohio State might have won the hearts and minds, as well
as the top ranking of news media members and coaches in each's
respective poll, but the Buckeyes apparently do not interface well
with computers. Each of the three computer services used in the BCS
formula _ including the New York Times computer ranking _ chose the
Bruins as No. 1 and helped push them past Ohio State in the new
ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really doesn't matter to me whether we are ranked first or
second in the BCS poll,'' said UCLA Coach Bob Toledo. ``The
important thing is to have a chance to play in the championship
game and you can do that being ranked first or second.''
</P>
<P>
   The BCS ranking is in place to insure that a clear-cut No. 1 and
No. 2 team will meet for a national championship game, this season
at the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 4. It compiles the poll placements, the
computer rankings, puts a numerical value on strength of schedule
and factors in a team's number of losses. In theory, never again
will an undefeated Michigan team and an undefeated Nebraska team
each win a national championship, as was the case last season.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA (6-0) earned a 3.04 point value in the ranking: 2 points
for poll average, 1 for computer average, 0.04 for strength of
schedule and 0 for losses. The Bruins were rewarded for playing
what the ranking determined as the nation's toughest schedule _ its
opponents are a combined 27-10 and include two BCS ranked teams,
No. 11 Oregon and No. 14 Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State earned 4.31 points _ one for poll average, 2.67 for
computer average, 0.64 for strength of schedule and 0 for losses.
They were penalized for what the formula determined was only the
16th best schedule (27-15 opponents' record) in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't worry about the BCS rating just like we can't worry
about our rankings in the national polls,'' said Ohio State Coach
John Cooper. ``I can say that we are happy to be ranked as high as
we are in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been the No. 1 team in both the major polls all season
and we're just going to keep working hard to try to win football
games. Winning takes care of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The point differential to the BCS' No. 3 and No. 4 teams bears
out Cooper's contention that, softer schedule or not, Ohio State
will play in the national title game if it remains undefeated. That
is because the news media and coaches polls still carry great
weight.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (6-0), for example, earned a 6.50 point value despite
playing what the BCS ranking says is the nation's second-toughest
schedule. The Vols have beaten the BCS's No. 7 team Florida, No. 13
Georgia and No. 20 Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Still, because Tennessee is ranked No. 3 by the news media and
No. 4 by the coaches gives the Vols 3.50 points in the poll
component alone, which is higher than UCLA's final tally of 3.04.
No. 4 Kansas State (7-0) is even further in the hole, 8.79 points,
because of its 3.50 poll value and the points it is assessed for
playing the nation's 49th-ranked schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ranking is intended to separate the best two teams from
the rest and make sure they face each other,'' said the BCS's
associate coordinator, Mark Womack. ``Nothing more.''
</P>
<P>
   The ranking will be released each Monday for the next six weeks
until Dec. 6, when they will be calculated for a final time and the
Fiesta Bowl matchup will be set. The ranking will have a
significant impact on the Rose, Sugar and Orange Bowls _ each of
which will be host to the title game on a rotating basis.
</P>
<P>
   First, each bowl will honor its commitments to its conference
tie-ins on the years the bowl is not playing host to the
championship game. If the season were to end today, for example,
Southeastern Conference champion and the BCS's No. 3 Tennessee
would go to the Sugar Bowl. The Orange Bowl would choose between
the Atlantic Coast and Big East champion, probably selecting No. 5
Florida State over No. 20 Syracuse. And the Rose Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   This year, the game playing host to the Big Ten and Pacific 10
champions _ Ohio State and UCLA _ would lose that marquee matchup
to the Fiesta Bowl, if the ranking stands. But organizers would get
the first two at-large picks and the chance for a dream matchup.
</P>
<P>
   Who is eligible for the the two at large berths?
</P>
<P>
   In the current ranking, all 20 teams because Syracuse is the
lowest-ranked BCS-affiliated conference leader. Jack French, the
Rose Bowl's executive director, relished the thought of picking
from such an attractive field. Kansas State, for example, would be
available because the Big 12 champion usually has an automatic
berth in the Fiesta. Imagine the Wildcats against No. 7 Florida. Or
how about an undefeated No. 9 Wisconsin against No. 11 Oregon to
stay in the Rose tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's No. 16 Notre Dame. The Irish haven't been to the
Rose Bowl since 1925 and could take on any of the aforementioned
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time we've had to do it and I find it
entertaining,'' said French. ``We have people talking about us. It
would be fun to have a greater mix of people on the West Coast.''
