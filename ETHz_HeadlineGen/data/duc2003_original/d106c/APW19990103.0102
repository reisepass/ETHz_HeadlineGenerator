	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Ohio State coach John Cooper has made his  
appeal to the voters in The Associated Press poll: If No. 2 Florida 
State barely beats No. 1 Tennessee in Monday night's Fiesta Bowl, 
consider the Buckeyes for the national title. 
</P>
<P>
	Seminoles coach Bobby Bowden says it won't work.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't blame John one bit for feeling the way he does,''  
Bowden said Sunday. ``John might have the best team in the nation, 
but if Tennessee wins, it will be the national champion. And if we 
win, we will be national champions. That's the way it was drawn up 
this year, and I sympathize with John because I've been in his 
place before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new Bowl Championship Series setup, the Fiesta Bowl  
winner automatically finishes No. 1 in the USA Today/ESPN coaches' 
poll. No. 3 Ohio State, 11-1 after a 24-14 win over Texas A&AMP;M in 
the Sugar Bowl, cannot be considered for the title in the coaches' 
poll. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP media poll, which has no such restrictions, will be  
released early Tuesday after the 70 voters cast their ballots. It's 
certainly a longshot, but at least the Buckeyes would have a chance 
to share the title. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Seminoles win, they would improve to 12-1, and they also  
have a win over Texas A&AMP;M -- 23-14 in the Kickoff Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Says Florida State defensive end Tony Bryant: ``They lost one  
game. We lost one game. They won their bowl game. I think the 
Fiesta Bowl should decide who the national champion is, but it's 
not up to us. We can just hope and pray that if we win, we will be 
national champions.''

	 *HEART-TO-HEART:* On the Monday after Florida State's 24-7 loss  
to North Carolina State, coach Bobby Bowden had a rare 
``heart-to-heart'' with his players. 
</P>
<P>
	``They could have not responded if they wanted to,'' Bowden said  
Sunday on the eve of the Fiesta Bowl . ``But they wouldn't have 
been around very long afterwards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Obviously, the Seminoles responded by winning their next 10  
games and squeezed their way into a title showdown against No. 1 
Tennessee only after losses by the two teams ranked ahead of them -- 
Kansas State and UCLA -- on the final day of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden said if his players didn't respond, he was set to go with  
a youth movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hit them with the fact that they, us, we, were trying live  
off last year's reputation, or the year before, or the year before, 
or the year before,'' Bowden said. ``The biggest enemy you have 
when you're successful is overconfidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive lineman Corey Simon said Bowden could have saved the  
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew that we had to step it up,'' Simon said. ``The coaches  
didn't have to say anything.'' 
</P>
<P>

	 *BCS FUTURE:* The Bowl Championship Series got through its first  
season with a minimum of controversy and a maximum of interest -- 
thanks largely to last-game losses by previously undefeated Kansas 
State and UCLA that set up a Tennessee-Florida State matchup in the 
Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Next season, the BCS' designated title game is the Sugar Bowl  
Jan. 3, 2000 at New Orleans. The Rose and Orange bowls will be 
played Jan. 1, the Fiesta Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 2000 season, the big game shifts to the Orange Bowl  
Jan. 1, 2001. The Rose and Fiesta bowls are Jan. 1, the Sugar Jan. 
2. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 2001 season, the top game moves to the Rose Bowl Jan.  
3, 2002 -- the first time the game will be played at night. The 
Sugar and Fiesta bowls are Jan. 1, the Orange Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NO. 1 VS. No. 2:* Florida State will be playing in a No. 1 vs.  
No. 2 game for the fifth time in the 1990s. The Seminoles are 2-2 
entering Monday night's Fiesta Bowl against top-ranked Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Florida State beat No. 1 Florida 24-21 Nov. 30, 1996, but then  
lost in the Sugar Bowl rematch and the Gators won the national 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Florida State beat No. 2 Nebraska 18-16 in the 1994 Orange  
Bowl, and won the '93 national title. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Notre Dame beat No. 1 Florida State 31-24, Nov. 13, 1993.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Miami beat No. 1 Florida State 17-16 Nov. 16, 1991.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *EXTRA POINTS:* The Fiesta Bowl marks the 32nd time No. 1 has  
played No. 2 since the AP poll began in 1936. It's also the first 
1-2 game since Florida State beat No. 1 Florida 24-21 Nov. 30, 
1996. ... The No. 2 team has won 10 of the last 16 1 vs. 2 games. 
... Florida State is 2-1 in Fiesta Bowls, 2-0 under coach Bobby 
Bowden. The Seminoles lost to Arizona State in the first Fiesta 
Bowl in 1971, then beat Nebraska twice in Tempe -- 31-28 in the 1998 
game and 41-17 in the '90 game. ... Florida State played eight bowl 
teams this season, including BCS teams Florida and Texas A&AMP;M. ... 
Tennessee also has wins over two BCS teams -- Syracuse and Florida. 
... The Seminoles have held five opponents to under 100 yards 
passing, and 10 teams were unable to complete 50 percent of their 
passes. ... Vols tailback Jamal Lewis was lost for the season in 
the fourth game, but Tennessee still led the SEC in rushing as 
Travis Henry posted five 100-yard plus games. ... Vols quarterback 
Tee Martin completed an NCAA record 23 straight passes in a win 
over South Carolina. ... The Seminoles are 97-12-1 in the 1990s, 
the best record in the nation. The Vols, at 89-19-2 are fourth, 
behind Nebraska and Florida.
