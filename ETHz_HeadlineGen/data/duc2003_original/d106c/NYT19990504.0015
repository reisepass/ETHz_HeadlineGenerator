   A fifth bowl could be added to the Bowl Championship Series as
soon as 2001 if a preliminary plan recently introduced to college
football officials earns approval.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is designed to quell the controversy created over the
past few years when bowls bypassed higher-ranked teams to create
match-ups that would sell more tickets and attract larger
television audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Kansas State and Arizona were left out of the
four-bowl series, while lower-ranked Florida was chosen to play in
the Orange Bowl. The year before, the Fiesta Bowl bypassed UCLA and
North Carolina to take Kansas State, which was ranked lower but
gave the bowl a better chance to fill Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan would add a fifth bowl to the rotation, but that
bowl's place in the process is undetermined. It would either match
two of the highest-ranking teams that weren't selected by the other
four bowls, or the bowl could included in the championship
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really haven't gotten that far to know what we're really
talking about,'' said Roy Kramer, commissioner of the Southeastern
Conference and coordinator of the BCS, which includes the Fiesta,
Orange, Sugar and Rose bowls.
</P>
<P>
   BCS officials will discuss the proposal again at a meeting this
summer. If the plan progresses, it could be approved for the 2001
season, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the bowls in the series takes turns hosting a game that
features the top two ranked teams in the country. The other bowls
have conference tie-ins that fill one slot in their games, and they
select BCS eligible teams for the other spots.
</P>
<P>
   The selection process created problems last year, the first
under the BCS agreement, and in previous years under the old Bowl
Alliance because deserving teams felt left out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through the first year of the BCS and the last three to five
years of the alliance, you can pretty much target two teams that
deserved very high consideration to be included at the BCS level,''
said John Junker, executive director of Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Because of geographical reasons, the most likely candidates to
be added to the rotation would be the Alamo Bowl in San Antonio and
the Cotton Bowl in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS already has two bowls in the Southeast and two in the
West. Adding a bowl in the Central time zone would be advantageous
for television purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't heard anything specific,'' said Derrick Fox,
executive director of the Alamo Bowl. ``Would we have an interest?
Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's counterpart with the Cotton Bowl, Rick Baker, also is
intrigued.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no earthly idea what the timetable is or where they
are in the process,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Baker has heard that a fifth bowl wouldn't be precluded from
hosting a national championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a business perspective,'' Fox said, ``that's where you
want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding a fifth bowl likely would mean extending the existing BCS
agreement, which has three more years remaining, with an option for
three more. It would also need the approval of ABC, which televises
BCS games.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of issues involved,'' Junker said, ``not
the least of which is what is the team selection process and what's
the arrangement for the championship game.''
</P>
<P>
   The BCS was created to guarantee a match-up between the top two
ranked teams in the country. The arrangement became possible when
the Rose Bowl agreed to join, making the Pac-10 and Big Ten
championships available.
</P>
<P>
   In previous years, those conferences' champions were locked into
the Rose Bowl, which had refused to join in the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS was successful this year in producing a national
championship game. No. 1-ranked Tennessee beat Florida State,
23-16, in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy was produced by the remaining bowls' freedom to
create match-ups, regardless of rankings.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Orange Bowl, by virtue of a conference
affiliation, took the Big East Conference champion, Syracuse. In
order to sell tickets, bowl officials then selected Florida as an
at-large team, bypassing Arizona and Kansas State.
