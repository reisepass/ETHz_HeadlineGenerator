	Year Two of the Bowl Championship Series will bring a few new  
wrinkles to the process of selecting the teams to play in its 
national championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	The BCS made a mostly successful debut last season, with  
Tennessee beating Florida State in the Fiesta Bowl and becoming the 
unanimous choice as the national champion. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the BCS modified its guidelines for selecting teams  
by adding five new computer ratings and toughened eligibility 
standards for its four bowl games. Also, a process is now in place 
that could strip weaker conferences of automatic bids, a move aimed 
at the Big East. 
</P>
<P>
	The BCS standings are determined through four factors: a  
combined ranking in The Associated Press media poll and USA 
Today/ESPN coaches' poll; computer surveys; strength of schedule; 
and won-loss record. 
</P>
<P>
	The series will again use the computer ratings of Jeff Sagarin,  
The New York Times and the Seattle Times. But it also will consider 
Richard Billingsley, Dunkel Index, Kenneth Massey, David Rothman 
and Matthews-Scripps Howard. A school's lowest ranking from the 
eight computer services will be thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
	Champions from the Big East, Big Ten, Big 12, SEC, Atlantic  
Coast and Pac-10 conferences receive automatic bids to the BCS, 
which also includes two at-large teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1-2 teams in the BCS standings are matched in a national  
title game that rotates among the Rose, Sugar, Orange and Fiesta 
bowls. Using a regional format, the other three bowls select the 
remaining conference champions and at-large teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 title game will be held Jan. 4 at the Sugar Bowl in New  
Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, teams were eligible for at-large berths with either  
eight victories or by finishing no lower than 12th in the BCS 
standings. Now, teams must have nine regular-season wins over 
Division I-A opponents and at least a No. 12 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, each of the six BCS leagues must show it is worthy of that  
status. If a conference's automatic qualifiers failed to average at 
least a No. 12 BCS rating over a four-year period, it could be 
stripped of the bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Big East champion Syracuse (8-4) was 15th in the  
BCS standings and was routed by Florida 31-10 in the Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the misconceptions of the BCS involved Kansas State,  
which ended up in the Alamo Bowl after losing only one game -- the 
Big 12 championship -- and finishing third in the final BCS 
standings. The feeling was that K-State, which lost to Purdue in 
the Alamo Bowl, deserved to play in a BCS game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still feel the bowls, after you get past the 1-2 game, need  
to have some regional flexibility,'' BCS chairman Roy Kramer said. 
``You can't take two West Coast teams and play in Miami. You've got 
to have regional ties to make the bowls succeed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first BCS standings will be released Oct. 25.
