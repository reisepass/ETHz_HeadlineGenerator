   TOPEKA _ Conservatives won a major victory in Kansas on
Wednesday when the state Board of Education approved new science
standards that dilute the teaching of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   In a 6-4 vote, the board ignored the recommendations of a
27-member state committee of scientists that spent a year drafting
new standards. The board adopted a modified version of the
standards that leaves the question of teaching evolution to the
state's 304 school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives hailed the decision as a step forward. But John
Staver, co-chairman of the committee of scientists that drafted the
standards, called it a ``travesty to science education'' and added:
``Kansas just embarrassed itself on the national stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the battle over science standards in Kansas has
attracted attention across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Staver said all of the members of the science writing committee
he had talked to _ more than half the total _ wanted their names
removed from the standards.
</P>
<P>
   They also want the board to remove the committee's dedication at
the top of the standards, which said: ``Our children are the future
of Kansas. With this document, we pass on the legacy of our own
teachers, who helped us to know that as lifelong learners of
science, we can live more productive, responsible and fulfilling
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The compromise version approved Wednesday was put together by
conservative board members Scott Hill and Steven Abrams, and by
Harold Voth, who had been considered a moderate. Joining in the
vote to adopt it were Linda Holloway, John Bacon and Mary Douglass
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The version deletes references to macroevolution, the process of
change from one species to another, but leaves references to
microevolution, or changes within species.
</P>
<P>
   It does not prohibit the teaching of evolution. But some fear
that teachers will drop the teaching because macroevolution will
not be included on state tests. There also are concerns that groups
could bring pressure on teachers to drop evolution from the
curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   During the meeting, board member Janet Waugh complained that she
did not have enough time to study the compromise version. She
wanted to delay the vote a month, she said, but was told before the
meeting that the vote would go forward.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Hill said that 95 percent of the material in
the compromise version was picked up from the writing committee's
fifth draft, which the board never voted on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see (the other 5 percent) as that huge of a change
that we had to start the process over again,'' he said, commenting
on Waugh's request for a delay.
</P>
<P>
   The new standards simply give more latitude to local school
districts in deciding what to teach about the origin of life,
conservatives said. Most teachers probably will continue to teach
evolution, Hill predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are you going to get a textbook that doesn't have
evolution in it?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Staver, however, said he believed the changes approved remove
evolution as a unifying concept tying the sciences together. Also,
he said, they open the door for the teaching of creation science
and the theory of intelligent design, which essentially says a
higher power created the universe.
</P>
<P>
   A science specialist in the Kansas City, Kan., School District
who was on the writing committee said she fears the changes also
could open the door to the teaching of concepts that the
conservatives don't want, such as New Age philosophies or
``occult-type things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be a teacher somewhere or a group somewhere who
would try to force that in,'' said Mary Blythe, district science
specialist for K-5. ``It's a sad day for science in Kansas.''
</P>
<P>
   Students who do not learn about evolution will be at a
disadvantage when they take college entrance exams, she and others
said. The conservatives, however, dispute that.
</P>
<P>
   National groups that monitor the teaching of evolution had
predictable reactions to the board vote.
</P>
<P>
   John Morris, president of the Institute for Creation Research, a
California think tank of scientists that deals with issues of
origin, applauded the action.
</P>
<P>
   Fossil records and other facts ``seem to fit the creationism
version of history better than the evolutionist version,'' Morris
said. ``I think what the Kansas school board has done is a strong
step forward for producing good students, good thinkers and good
scientists.''
</P>
<P>
   But Molleen Matsumura of the National Center for Science
Education, a Berkeley, Calif., group that supports the teaching of
evolution, said no one should downplay the changes made by the
board.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are some of the most extensive changes I have seen,''
she said. ``There were paragraphs and paragraphs that were just
removed.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most important underlying concepts of evolution were
removed, she said, and whether they will be taught will now be the
option of local school districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to make it optional is like trying to make it optional
to talk about gravity in a physics class,'' she said. ``The real
losers are the children of Kansas.''
</P>
<P>
   Evolution has been tested in enough states now to grab the
attention of the national media, Matsumura said. The media probably
got interested in Kansas because the debate has dragged on for
months, she said, and because even the governor came out in the
foray, expressing opposition to the compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The new standards could face a legal challenge from either the
American Civil Liberties Union or Americans United for Separation
of Church and State, a Washington group. Both expressed their
concerns to the board before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the national science organizations that supported the
writing committee's drafts want to take a close look at the changes
the board has adopted, Staver said. They want to make sure the
standards don't attribute anything to them that they disagree with.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway, the board chairman, said the board planned to consult
with its attorney to see if the new standards would meet a legal
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, she said, the board will move forward with
implementation.
</P>
<P>
   The standards will be sent to all school districts, she said,
and teachers will be trained in them. At the same time, she said,
assessments will be built for testing the new standards.
</P>
<P>
   The standards are expected to take effect in the 2000-2001
school year.
