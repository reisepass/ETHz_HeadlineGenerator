   LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) -- The audience was encouraged to applaud,
murmur, hiss or shout hallelujah. One sign on stage simply called
for ''hubbub'' -- not surprising, given the subject being debated.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-five years after the Scopes ''monkey trial'' over the
teaching of evolution, parts of the landmark court case were
re-enacted in Kansas, the latest ground zero in the battle over
what to teach kids about the origin of life.
</P>
<P>
   As about 1,500 people watched, actors read from transcripts of
the 1925 trial in Tennessee that pitted William Jennings Bryan
against defense attorney Clarence Darrow.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was never in doubt. Biology teacher John Scopes was
convicted and fined $100 for teaching evolution. His conviction was
later overturned by the Tennessee Supreme Court on procedural
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   One exchange elicited both laughter and applause. Bryan, played
by Ed Asner (''Lou Grant,'' ''Mary Tyler Moore Show''), turned to
his colleague and said: ''You may guess -- evolutionists guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Darrow, played by James Cromwell (''Babe,'' ''L.A.
Confidential''), replied, ''But when we do guess, we have the sense
to guess right.''
</P>
<P>
   The People for the American Way Foundation sponsored the event
as well as a panel discussion and debate on evolution and
creationism following the performance.
</P>
<P>
   Foundation president Ralph Neas said the state education board's
decision in August 1999 to de-emphasize evolution in science
testing standards made Kansas a natural venue for the event.
</P>
<P>
   ''How Kansas resolves this dispute will ripple out in all
directions to affect the education of millions of children who have
never even set foot in this state,'' Neas said.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution, first propounded by Charles Darwin, states that the
Earth is billions of years old and that life forms developed over
millions of years.
</P>
<P>
   Creationism, or creation science, teaches that the Earth and
most life forms came into existence suddenly about 6,000 years ago.
Critics have attacked it as a disguise for a literal translation of
the Bible's Book of Genesis.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup Poll conducted last year found that 68 percent of
American adults favored teaching both creationism and evolution in
the public schools. By a margin of 55 percent to 40 percent, they
opposed replacing evolution with creationism. The margin of error
was plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has heated up recently in a number of states,
including Alabama, Idaho, Nebraska, New Mexico, West Virginia,
Arizona, Michigan, Indiana, Louisiana, Kentucky, Oklahoma,
Illinois, Washington and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Neas said activities in those states have ranged from efforts to
delete evolution from science standards and tests to including a
disclaimer in textbooks downplaying the importance of the theory.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, the science standards that de-emphasize evolution
also make no mention of the big-bang theory of the origin of the
universe. The standards are used to develop statewide tests for
students.
</P>
<P>
   The board's decision to approve them focused national attention
on Kansas and made evolution a political issue. Five of the board's
10 seats will be filled in the Nov. 7 general election.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Holloway, who was the board's chairwoman when it approved
the new science standards and is seeking re-election, said that
while the evolution debate continues 75 years after the Scopes
trial, creationists are the ones under attack now.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've come 180 degrees; now we've got censorship the other
way,'' Holloway said Tuesday at the board's monthly meeting. She
did not attend Wednesday's event, which drew people on both sides
of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Krebs, representing Kansas Citizens for Science,
distributed fliers criticizing the Kansas board's decision, while
Eric and Celtie Johnson displayed anti-evolution signs. One said,
''Reject evolution, thousands of scientists do!''
</P>
<P>
   Before the re-creation, Kansas native Asner said scientists have
accumulated evidence in ''a million different ways'' to support
evolution since the Scopes trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kansas has put itself in a more bumbling situation with this
board than Tennessee was 75 years ago,'' he said.
