   CHICAGO _ The Kansas Board of Education voted Wednesday to
delete virtually any mention of evolution from the state's science
curriculum, in one of the most far-reaching efforts by creationists
in recent years to challenge the teaching of evolution in schools.
</P>
<P>
   While the move does not prevent the teaching of evolution, it
will not be included in the state assessment tests that students
take, which may discourage teachers and students from spending time
on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   And the decision is likely to embolden local school boards
seeking to remove evolution from their curriculums, force teachers
to note questions about its validity, or introduce creationist
ideas. Some local school boards have already said they will
consider adopting creationist textbooks, even though others have
said they will continue teaching evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Creationists say a divine being created humans and other
species. They say that since evolution cannot be observed or
replicated in a laboratory, there is no evidence that it actually
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas is the latest state to face a battle over evolution and
creationism in recent years. Alabama, New Mexico and Nebraska have
made changes that, to varying degrees, challenge the preeminence of
evolution in the scientific curriculum. Others, like Texas, Ohio,
Washington, New Hampshire and Tennessee, have considered, but
ultimately defeated, similar bills, including some that would have
required those who teach evolution to also present evidence
contradicting it. At the local level, dozens of school boards are
trying to make similar changes.
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade after the Supreme Court concluded that states
could not compel the teaching of creationism, creationists appear
to be increasingly active, adopting a new strategy to get around
the constitutional issues. Instead of trying to push creationism
onto the curriculum, many creationists are trying to keep Darwin
out of the classroom or insure that if evolution is taught, it is
presented as merely one, unproven theory.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, for example, biology textbooks carry a sticker
calling evolution ``a controversial theory some scientists present
as a scientific explanation for the origin of living things.'' The
disclaimer adds: ``No one was present when life first appeared on
earth. Therefore, any statement about life's origins should be
considered as theory, not fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Moore, a biology professor at the University of Louisville
and editor of the magazine of the National Association of Biology
Teachers, said, ``It's going on everywhere, and the creationists
are winning.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the issue was so charged in some school districts that
some teachers simply choose not to teach evolution, rather than
risk an outcry from parents, churches or local school boards.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip E. Johnson, a law professor at the University of
California at Berkeley, who is affiliated with a creationist group
and has written books attacking ``misrepresentations'' and
``propaganda'' in the teaching of evolution, said defending
evolution was becoming ``the science educators' Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas decision is significant because the new curriculum
not only deletes most references to biological evolution, it also
deletes references to ideas like the big bang theory, which holds
that the universe was born from a vast explosion, and includes at
least one case study that creationists use to debunk evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of changes made, the thoroughness with which
references to evolution are deleted or definitions changed, it's
more extensive than what we've seen before,'' said Molleen
Matsumura, network project director of the National Center for
Science Education.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Looy, a spokesman for Answers in Genesis, a creationist
group planning a ``creation museum of natural history,'' said he
thought the Kansas vote was important because he believes
``students in public schools are being taught that evolution is a
fact, that they're just products of survival of the fittest,'' said
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not meaning in life if we're just animals in a
struggle for survival,'' Looy said. ``It creates a sense of
purposelessness and hopelessness, which I think leads to things
like pain, murder and suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Many creationists believe that the Bible shows life on earth
cannot be more than 10,000 years old. Some have adopted a less
religious interpretation, saying the earth was created by an
``intelligent designer'' because it is simply too complex to be
explained any other way.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution, considered by scientists to be the cornerstone of
biology, is the theory that, based on fossils, anatomy and genetic
evidence, life began on earth about 3.9 billion years ago and
humans and other species evolved from a common ancestor. Scientists
point out that much of science cannot be repeated in a laboratory
and yet no one doubts the existence of, say, atoms.

</P>
<P>
   Recently, creationists have been searching for events they say
raise doubts about evolution or suggest the world is much younger
than scientists claim. One common example is the 1980 eruption of
Mount St. Helen's, which creationists say proves geologic changes
can happen very rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   The new Kansas science standards include Mount St. Helen's and
Mount Etna as examples that ``suggest alternative explanations to
scientific hypotheses or theories.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas debate began over a year ago when the state appointed
a committee of 27 scientists and professors to write a state
version of new national science guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   But when those standards were submitted to the board, a
conservative member, Steve Abrams, a veterinarian and former head
of the state Republican Party, said he ``had some serious questions
about it,'' claiming ``it is not good science to teach evolution as
fact.''
</P>
<P>
   With the help of members of a creationist group, Abrams rewrote
the standards, deleting most of the two pages on evolution, as well
as the big bang theory. What remained was ``micro-evolution,''
which refers to genetic adaptation and natural selection within a
species. But ``macro-evolution,'' the origin of species, was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams also attempted to insert these words: ``The design and
complexity of the design of the cosmos requires an intelligent
designer.''
</P>
<P>
   But after protest from scientists, that sentence was stricken in
the final version, which was approved by a vote of 6-4; the
standards are recommendations only, and it is still up to local
school boards in Kansas to decide what will actually be taught in
the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   But biologists, like Steve Case, who was on the original
standards committee, said that because ``evolution is such a
unifying principle of biology,'' the new standards could mean
students will be unprepared for college admission tests and college
science courses. Some teachers said they would continue to teach
evolution and resign if forced not to.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Wagnon, a board member who opposed the new standards, said
``the effort to emphasize the rock of ages more than the age of
rocks'' could make Kansas science students ``the laughing stock of
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   A watchdog group, Americans United for Separation of Church and
State, said it might sue if it decides the standards favor
creationism.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bill Graves, a Republican, also opposed the changes and
predicted that the legislature might try to make the board an
appointed, rather than an elected body.
</P>
<P>
   But the climate in Kansas and elsewhere may complicate things. A
nationwide Gallup poll found that about 45 percent of those asked
believed in creationism and another 40 percent believed evolution
was set in motion by a divine being. Polls of scientists have found
that about 40 percent share the latter view.
</P>
<P>
   The Topeka Capital-Journal recently editorialized that
``creationism is as good a hypothesis as any for how the universe
began.''
</P>
<P>
   And even some science teachers underscore the complexity. Lu
Bitter, who is co-chairwoman of the high school science department
in Pratt, Kan., said she strongly opposed the new standards and was
also fighting a proposal before her school board to adopt a
creationist textbook.
</P>
<P>
   But she said that the school's biology teachers have spent time
discussing creationism, as well as evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've covered all views, read Genesis in the classroom and we
use a video that shows three different views,'' Mrs. Bitter said.
</P>
<P>
   When students leave class, ``they know that there are different
ways of looking at the way life exists on earth,'' she said.
