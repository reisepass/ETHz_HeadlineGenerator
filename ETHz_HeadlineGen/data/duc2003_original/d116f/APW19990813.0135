	TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- Some local Kansas officials are not planning  
to change what their schools teach about evolution, even though the 
State Board of Education's new testing standards de-emphasize its 
importance, especially the theory that men descended from apes. 
</P>
<P>
	Local school districts will continue to decide what subjects are  
taught in their classrooms. Both critics and supporters of the 
standards approved Wednesday said they could influence some lesson 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	But some schools and teachers said they don't plan to make any  
changes in how they deal with evolution. And Gov. Bill Graves 
scoffed at the idea of kicking evolution out of schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this decision is so out of sync with reality that in  
some ways it minimizes, sort of, the credibility and the oversight 
that the state board is supposed to have on schools,'' said Kansas 
Gov. Bill Graves, who opposed the new standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The state board won't be able to stop the teaching of evolution,  
he said. ``What are they going to do, hire the evolution police?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marjorie Kaplan, superintendent of the big Shawnee Mission  
district in the Kansas City suburban area, said: ``We're going to 
cover the same material as we have in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Education Commissioner Andy Tompkins -- who as the state's top  
education administrator works for the state board -- said Thursday 
the standards won't remove evolution from Kansas classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think nearly every biology book in the world has that  
covered,'' Tompkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's old science standards did not say what topics should  
be included on statewide tests administered to public school 
students, but they did say that evolution was something students 
should learn before they graduate from high school. 
</P>
<P>
	The new standards are far more specific. The include references  
to ``microevolution,'' or changes within species. They also mention 
natural selection, the idea that advantageous traits increase in a 
population over time. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the standards do not include language recommended by a  
committee of 27 science educators describing evolution as a 
fundamental scientific tenet. Nor do they include a section on 
``macroevolution,'' the process of change from one species to 
another. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes mean the state is not planning to include questions  
about macroevolution, or dealing with theories of the origin of the 
universe, on its statewide tests, used to evaluate how well schools 
are teaching. The new science tests are supposed to be administered 
starting in spring 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Evolution is the theory that all life evolved from common  
ancestors. Those opposed to it say it contradicts the biblical 
account of the creation of life, and they object to the idea that 
human life resulted from a lower life form. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a decade ago, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that public  
schools can't teach creationism, the theory that a divine being 
created the universe. Opponents of the new standards say 
conservatives are trying their only remaining tactic -- to limit the 
teaching of evolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas is one of a number of states, including Arizona, Alabama,  
Illinois, New Mexico, Texas and Nebraska, where school boards 
recently have attempted to take evolution out of state science 
standards or de-emphasize evolutionary concepts. 
</P>
<P>
	Some educators see the debate over evolution shifting to local  
school boards. 
</P>
<P>
	In Colby, about 55 miles from the Colorado border, School  
Superintendent Kirk Nielsen said residents are conservative and 
``other theories like creationism come up in class and we discuss 
them.''
