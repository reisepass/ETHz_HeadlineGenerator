   Stop the world. Kansas wants to get off. In fact, it already has
one foot dragging.
</P>
<P>
   The state Board of Education has removed evolution from the list
of matters that public school biology students must know.
</P>
<P>
   Local districts may continue teaching evolution if they wish,
but with the state board caving in to religious and cultural
conservatives, local schools have been set up for similar muggings.
Many will be unwilling to hold out against the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The board's 6-4 vote was an appalling example of knowledge by
pressure group, a sure shortcut to boobery. The understanding of
evolution is absolutely central to modern biology. Voting it away
is akin to removing math from physics.
</P>
<P>
   Students in Kansas are left with little to learn in biology but
the names of plants and animals _ toddler stuff. An understanding
of the science's animating dynamic will be denied them. Don't
expect many to go on to science in college.
</P>
<P>
   All this because some Christian literalists can't square the
biblical creation story with the fossil and DNA records that, among
what are by now tons of evidence, confirm the evolutionary process.
Unable to force their contrary pseudo-science of creationism into
public curricula _ the courts quickly saw through that dodge for
slipping sectarian religion into public classrooms _ the
fundamentalists are settling for killing evolution off by political
fiat.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure had grown so intense last year that the National
Academy of Sciences was forced to the distinctly odd act of issuing
an urgent plea for the teaching of evolution _ a pitch that ought
to be as unnecessary as having to plead that grammar or subtraction
be taught.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska and New Mexico have downgraded the teaching of
evolution, and Alabama requires that biology texts carry what
amounts to a warning label. Ohio, Texas, Washington, New Hampshire
and Tennessee have had to fight off anti-evolution crusades.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help that grandstanding politicians lend themselves
to this foolishness. Arguably, it was Ronald Reagan, campaigning
for the presidency, who licensed the contemporary activism against
evolution when he told a convention of fundamentalists he doubted
evolution is real. GOP House Whip Tom Delay recently blamed the
teaching of evolution in part for the Columbine High School
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas Gov. Bill Graves and several state legislators _ some,
like Graves, moderate Republicans _ are considering either
abolishing the state school board or stripping its authority over
study content.
</P>
<P>
   They and other politicians willing to uphold intellectual
integrity deserve more public support than is usually forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Most Christians have no problem accepting both the science of
evolution and the awe-inspiring sweep and elegance of biblical
creation, but their absence from this little war _ and it has
become one _ is leaving the field to reactionary activists speaking
in the name of their religion.
