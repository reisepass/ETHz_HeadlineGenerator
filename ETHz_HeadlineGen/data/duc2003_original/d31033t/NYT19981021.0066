   Following is the text of the first two sections of the Sherman
Act, as passed by Congress in 1890. As the foundation on which
federal antitrust law has been built, the act has been amended
several times _ elevating the crime to a felony, increasing the
fines and prison terms for individuals and setting fines for
corporations convicted of violating it. In the case of Microsoft,
the government has invoked the Sherman Act to file a civil suit
that seeks to change the company's business practices, not a
criminal suit that seeks financial penalties.
