	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Patricia Pena gave little thought to using a cellular
telephone on the road before a distracted driver hit her car broadside, fatally
injuring her 2-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
	   Now she has devoted herself to pushing for a nationwide ban on cell phone
use in cars, except in emergencies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's too late for my daughter, but I feel compelled to lobby for my baby
and for other people's babies,'' said Pena, 29.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers in states and cities across the nation are considering legislation
to ban drivers from talking on cell phones. Without statistics that track
fatalities related to cell phone use, critics point to a 1997 study that
suggests talking on a cell phone while driving is about as dangerous as being
close to legally drunk behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
	   No state bans the use of wireless phones in automobiles, and only
California, Florida and Massachusetts have laws limiting cell phone use in
moving vehicles, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Only Oklahoma and Minnesota require police to include information about cell
phones in accident reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Morgan Pena died a day after the Nov. 2 accident in Hilltown when a driver
ran a stop sign and slammed into her mother's car. The driver admitted he was
distracted while talking on his cell phone. He was cited for reckless driving
and fined $50.
</P>
<P>
	   Hilltown now bans certain cell phone uses for drivers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we're hoping is by us and other municipalities taking action, the
state Legislature will understand how supportive the residents of Pennsylvania
are of this and look at passing a state law,'' said Ken Bennington, chairman of
the Board of Supervisors.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the ordinance, which took effect last month, a driver cannot be
stopped for using a mobile phone but can be fined $75 if pulled over for another
violation. Emergency services workers and motorists calling 911 are exempt.
</P>
<P>
	   The ordinance, and another passed last month in the Philadelphia suburb of
Conshohocken, is based on one passed last March in Brooklyn, Ohio, where police
have issued more than 80 citations with $2 fines.
</P>
<P>
	   Proposals to ban car phone use have been introduced in Massachusetts and in
Nebraska, where talking on a cell phone would be considered contributory
negligence in auto accidents. At least 300 towns and cities, including Chicago,
are considering local ordinances.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1997 study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, concluded
that talking on a cell phone while driving quadruples the risk of an accident.
Researchers said losing concentration, not fiddling with the phone itself,
creates the hazard, so talking on a hands-free model is just as risky.
</P>
<P>
	   According to a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration report, a
proliferation of more high-tech auto gadgetry -- on-board navigation systems,
fax machines -- could heighten driver distractions and lead to more crashes.
</P>
<P>
	   An estimated 85 percent of the nation's approximately 80 million cell phone
subscribers use the devices while driving.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know I probably shouldn't be using one when I'm driving. You do get
distracted on the road, but you can get a lot of work done,'' said Jerry
Siedlecki, a claims representative for a Philadelphia insurance company.
</P>
<P>
	   Educating drivers about how to use their cell phones responsibly will do
more good that an outright ban, said Lisa Ihde, spokeswoman for the Cellular
Communications Industry Association, a Washington-based industry group
representing wireless carriers and manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't want to see any legislation that would deter drivers from taking
their phone with them in their cars,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, 15 states attempted to address the issue with legislation. In
Pennsylvania, the bill calls for the state to track accidents related to cell
phones, require drivers to pull over when using phones and fine violators. A
hearing is tentatively scheduled for March.
</P>
<P>
	   Such measures have failed to get out of committee in many states, including
New York, where bills prohibiting use of hand-held phones while driving have
languished in committee since 1996. Gov. George Pataki has called such a law
unenforceable.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that's kind of a copout,'' said Brendan McGrath, spokesman for
Westchester County Assemblyman Ronald Tocci, whose district recorded several
auto fatalities blamed on cell phone use. ``Obviously if a cop sees you're not
wearing a seat belt, he can see if you're operating a phone.''
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents of outright bans believe the benefits of car phones -- the ability
to quickly report drunken drivers, accidents and breakdowns -- far outweigh any
drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are 100,000 calls a day placed to 911 through wireless phones,''
Ihde said. ``Those people are saving lives and stopping crime.''
</P>
<P>
	   The benefits do nothing to deter Pena from her crusade.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You never think something like this can happen to you, until it does,''
she said. ``I'm not going to give up until something is done.''
