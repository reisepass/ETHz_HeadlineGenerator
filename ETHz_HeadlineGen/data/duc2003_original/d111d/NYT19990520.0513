   NEW YORK _ The notoriously garrulous New York City taxi driver
is about to become a little less talkative.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on a rising number of passenger complaints, the Taxi and
Limousine Commission passed a new regulation Thursday that
prohibits cabbies from using cellular phones while driving.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers who violate the rule will face a $200 fine and two
penalty points on their licenses.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said the new rule, which takes effect July 1,
makes New York one the first municipalities in the country to
outlaw mobile phone use while driving, if only for the city's
90,000 taxi, car service and limousine drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think a passenger has the right to get into a cab and not
have a driver who is chatting on the phone,'' said the commission's
chairwoman, Diane McGrath-McKechnie. ``They are entitled to a
driver who is focused on the road, not the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   The new measure would not apply to two-way radios that
livery-cab drivers use to talk to their dispatchers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the commission does not keep a tally of accidents
related to cellular phone use, Ms. McGrath-McKechnie said a recent
study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found
that drivers who used a mobile phone behind the wheel had a higher
accident rate.
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian study published in 1997 concluded that hands-free
phones were no safer than hand-held phones.
</P>
<P>
   Most cabbies and passengers interviewed Thursday agreed with the
new rule, saying that cell phone use by drivers is both rude and
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how distracting it is because I've had a few near
misses myself,'' said Mary Liz McDonald, 32, a film producer from
Hoboken, N.J., who was stepping into a taxi at the Port Authority
Bus Terminal last night. ``Taking a New York City cab is perilous
as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. McDonald, who has orchestrated many deals while driving,
would object to such a ban for everyone else. ``I couldn't exist if
I wasn't able to drive and talk on the phone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Farooq A. Bhatti, the director of Pak Brothers Yellow Cab
Drivers Union, a fraternal organization, said he thought the ban
was a good idea. Bhatti said that as he was driving from La Guardia
Airport Thursday, he saw two limousine drivers who were both using
cell phones get into a minor accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both got out of their cars yelling at each other and
telling their callers to hold on,'' he said. ``It was ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone approved of the ban, especially the cellular
phone industry. James J. Gerace, a spokesman for Bell Atlantic
Mobile, said cellular phone companies would try to amend the
regulations to allow drivers to use hands-free phones and
voice-activated dialing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this measure will discourage drivers from using cell
phones at all,'' he said, ``which would be too bad, since the
safety benefits of carrying a mobile phone have been well
documented.''
