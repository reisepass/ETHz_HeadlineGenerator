   AUSTIN, Texas _ As more than 94 million wireless phone users are
taking to the road nationwide, a new poll shows Texans fear that
chatting drivers are a big risk at the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, conducted May 22 to June 16 by Scripps Howard Data
Center, surveyed 1,000 Texans by telephone in a systematic random
sample. The margin of error is 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   According to the poll, 42 percent of Texans polled own cellular
phones. Of those, 55 percent use the phones daily and 27 percent
use them daily while driving, but only 20 percent use hands-free
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, 92 percent of those asked said driving and talking
on the phone is dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of legislation, 59 percent polled said they would
support state legislation banning talking on the phone while
driving and 56 percent said they would support a similar measure by
their local city government.
</P>
<P>
   The survey results point to drivers growing frustrations with
cellular phone users distracted at the wheel, said State Rep. Paul
Moreno of El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have observed a lot of people driving and using a cell
phone. It seems like it is every other person,'' he said. ``It
creates a danger _ not only to themselves, but to me as well.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past session, Moreno proposed a bill to limit
cellular phone usage while driving to only when the car is stopped
or with hands-free equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The bill died in a transportation subcommittee, but Moreno said
it had widespread support in the House and that he most likely will
bring it up again at the next session in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Just how dangerous using the phone while driving is in Texas is
unclear. Most law enforcement agencies do not track cell phone use
in accidents. The Texas Department of Public Safety just started,
so no statistics are available yet, said spokesman Tom Vinger.
Before identifying wireless phone use as an accident cause, it fell
under the driver-inattention category.
</P>
<P>
   DPS officers will not pull over someone for talking on a
telephone while driving. But if the driver is not paying attention
or committing other traffic violations as a result, they will get
ticketed, Vinger said.
</P>
<P>
   But cellular phones can be helpful when stranded or to report
drunken drivers to the police, Vinger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that takes away from your attention to driving is
bad,'' he said. ``If it gets to that point, you've crossed the
line. But it is also a useful tool.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas is not alone in trying to limit cellular phone use while
driving. During the past legislative session this year, 27 other
states introduced similar bills.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these propositions will probably die, said Melissa
Savage, a policy specialist for the National Conference of State
Legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Three states _ Massachusetts, Florida and California _ passed
mild laws on cell phone use. Massachusetts requires drivers to keep
one hand on the steering wheel and states that the phone cannot
interfere with driving.
</P>
<P>
   Florida mandates that one ear must be free and California says
that rental cars must include safe-use instructions for phones.
</P>
<P>
   Only three cities _ Brooklyn, Ohio; Hilltown Township, Pa.; and
Athens, Colo. _ have passed ordinances about limiting cell phone
use while driving.
</P>
<P>
   The wireless industry opposes such legislation, but it sends
safety tip cards with bills and places pamphlets at retailers, said
Lisa Ihde, a consumer educator for the trade group Cellular
Telecommunications Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   Driver distractions, ranging from yelling at children to eating
to talking with passengers, remains the real problem, Ihde said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no established causal relationship between accidents
and wireless phone use,'' she said. ``The issue is not with phones
then. It is something else.''
