<P>
   With more than 70 million Americans now regularly using cell
phones, concerns are mounting about the public danger of distracted
motorists talking on their phones while they drive.
</P>
<P>
   But while some communities are banning the practice, a new
Harvard University study cautions that the risks of using a cell
phone while driving have not been clearly shown _ and that the
benefits for public safety and personal productivity should be
considered, too.
</P>
<P>
   While some people using phones may drive erratically and in rare
cases crash into other cars or pedestrians, cell phones also are a
boon for reporting accidents and drunken drivers and for making
better use of one's time, the study authors said.
</P>
<P>
   From a cost-benefit standpoint, researchers at the Harvard
Center for Risk Analysis say, banning the use of cell phones would
be far less productive than lowering the speed limit to 55 miles
per hour or requiring more effective air bags and seat belts in
cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risks of using a cell phone while driving are real, but
they're smaller than many other risks you face in everyday life,
and the benefits are very real and may be larger than have been
previously realized,'' said Karen Lissy, the study's lead author
and director of the center's Program on Motor Vehicles and Public
Health.
</P>
<P>
   The study was funded under a $300,000 grant from AT&AMP;T Wireless,
one of the nation's biggest cell phone providers. But it was
reviewed for objectivity by 12 specialists, including some leading
opponents of cell phone usage while driving, the study's authors
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the National Highway Transportation Safety
Administration urged that drivers avoid talking on cell phones _ or
using other new electronic devices like on-board computers _ while
behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Driver distraction in all its forms is a real threat to the
safety of American roads,'' agency deputy chief Rosalyn Millman
said at a Washington hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond today's epidemic of motorists using one hand to drive
while talking on wireless phones, Millman said, ``The plethora of
gadgets and gizmos that are being designed into vehicles may be the
much bigger threat of tomorrow. Will we learn about those risks and
deal with them expeditiously? Or will we wait for rising numbers of
deaths and injuries?''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of US communities, including Brooklyn, Ohio, Marlboro
Township, N.J., and three Pennsylvania towns, have enacted local
ordinances banning the use of hand-held phones while driving. At
least 19 states are considering laws banning the practice. France,
Japan and Sweden have laws regulating cell phone use while driving.
</P>
<P>
   Only two states, Minnesota and Oklahoma, compile data on cell
phones as a contributing factor to accidents. Using multiple
sources, the Harvard study estimates the risk of an American dying
while driving and using a cell phone is about 6.4 in 1 million per
year. That compares to a 30 in 1 million chance per year of a
driver dying from driving drunk for a half-hour every month.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, the risk that a motorist will be killed by a
driver using a cell phone is 1.5 in 1 million annually, about
1/12th the risk of being killed in a crash with a large truck or
with a sober driver not using a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   But a 1997 New England Journal of Medicine study of 699 drivers
in accidents found that using a phone increased by fourfold the
risk of having a crash.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard report also calculates the benefits to society of
banning cell phone usage while driving according to a standard
public health formula called cost per quality-adjusted life-year
saved. It attributes a higher value to a healthy year of life
compared to a year spent sick or maimed.
</P>
<P>
   Taking an American Enterprise Institute-Brookings Institution
estimate that the economic benefits of using a cell phone while
driving amount to $25 billion annually in the United States, the
study projects it would cost $700,000 per quality-adjusted year of
life saved from a ban on cell phone use while driving.
</P>
<P>
   That cost is anywhere from 9 to 30 times as expensive as
imposing a 55 miles per hour national speed limit, or requiring
added air bags, seat belts and side-door beams in vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless industry officials contend the answer is better public
education and advertising including an industry campaign urging
people to ``make safety your most important call.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Wheeler, president of the Cellular Telecommunications
Industry Association, said Americans made 118,000 emergency calls
to hospitals and police last year, suggesting a large benefit from
summoning quicker help for accident victims.
