	   JERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP) - Mayor Bret Schundler vetoed a measure
Thursday that would have made Jersey City the second New Jersey
community to ban cellular telephone use while driving.
</P>
<P>
   The councilman who sponsored the ordinance said he may seek an
override. City Council passed the ordinance by a 7-1 vote on Sept.
13. A two-thirds vote of the nine-member council is needed for an
override.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Marlboro Township became the first community in New
Jersey to prohibit the use of hand-held cellular telephones while
driving. Under its ban, anyone caught driving with a hand-held cell
phone is subject to a fine of up to $250.
</P>
<P>
   The Jersey City ordinance would fine violators between $200 and
$1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Fernando Colon said he has seen bus drivers talking
on cellular telephones in full buses and people arguing heatedly
while driving.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one is going to tell me that if you're in that mood you're
really concentrating,'' Colon said.
</P>
<P>
   Colon said he may seek a veto override at the council's Sept. 27
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Schundler said the state should decide the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is simply unfair and impractical to expect drivers to learn
which of New Jersey's 566 municipalities permit them to drive while
speaking on their cellular phones and which do not,'' Schundler
said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also said police are already empowered to cite
motorists for reckless driving, which could stem from cellular
telephone use.
