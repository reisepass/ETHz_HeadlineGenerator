   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Chatting on a cell phone while driving
will remain legal in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   After a lengthy debate Thursday, lawmakers used a voice vote to
kill legislation that would have banned the practice.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters argued the measure, raised as an amendment to a bill
on child safety in motor vehicles, would reduce accidents on
Connecticut roads. Rep. Richard Roy, who sponsored the bill, said
driving with a hand-held phone is as bad as driving drunk.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're four times more likely to have an accident,'' said Roy,
D-Milford.
</P>
<P>
   Critics maintained the ban would be difficult to enforce and do
little to improve safety. They said motorists are more distracted
by a host of other activities -- from eating and drinking while
driving to finding a station on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lawrence Cafero Jr., R-Norwalk, waved a Styrofoam cup of
tea and a bag of candy, and pretended to beat back imaginary
children in the car to illustrate the distractions he faces on a
typical drive.
</P>
<P>
   ''This doesn't stop all of that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers said there are already laws on the books that
achieve the goal of the amendment more simply and efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a law to take care of the weaving in and out of
traffic-- it's called reckless driving,'' said Rep. Lee Samowitz,
D-Bridgeport.
</P>
<P>
   An exception to the ban would have been made for motorists using
their cellular phones to make 911 or other emergency calls. Police
and fire officials would also have been exempt.
</P>
<P>
   Hands-free cellular phones would have remained legal to use
under the measure.
</P>
<P>
   There were an estimated 58 million cellular phones in use
nationwide in 1998, Roy said. Statistics show there will be about
80 million by year's end, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Fontana, D-North Haven, said the ban would have been
in line with state statutes governing seat belt use, drunken
driving and the safe construction of cars.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a precedent to pass such laws,'' he said.
