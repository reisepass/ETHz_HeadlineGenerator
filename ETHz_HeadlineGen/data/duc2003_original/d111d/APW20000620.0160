	   MARLBORO, N.J. (AP) - AT&AMP;T has sent a clear message to Marlboro
officials: the telecommunications giant does not support the
township's proposed ban on the use of cellular phones while
driving.
</P>
<P>
   ''AT&AMP;T opposes any legislation or regulation that restricts our
customers' use of their wireless phones or any law that treats
wireless phones in cars any differently than any other potential
distraction, such as food, drinks, children, pets, radios, CD
players, tapes, shavers and computers,'' wrote Dennis M. Maher,
director of AT&AMP;T's government affairs unit, in a letter dated June
19.
</P>
<P>
   The Township Council is expected to introduce the proposed ban
Thursday. The ordinance would restrict all but police, fire and
emergency personnel from using hand-held cell phones while driving.
Exceptions are made for cell phones that can be operated by
speakerphone or with an earpiece. Violators could face a $200 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Township Council Vice President Barry Denkensohn sponsored the
measure. ''They oppose (the ban) even if the activity causes
accidents?'' he said. ''I just think the letter is preposterous.
It's like a lobbyist's response and I wouldn't have expected
anything different. They're going to promote their products and
don't want any restrictions.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Wireless Group has 12 million cell phone customers in the
nation. The number of New Jersey customers was not available, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a matter of affecting business,'' said Kathe
Dominick, spokeswoman for AT&AMP;T Wireless Group.
</P>
<P>
   The company opposes the measure because it believes
municipalities do not have jurisdiction over motor vehicle
regulations, Dominick said. She would not comment, however, on
whether AT&AMP;T would support a state-imposed ban.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey is one of 22 states that have proposed such a ban,
but none have been enacted.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimated
that there would be 80 million mobile phone users in the United
States in 2000. Studies suggest more than 85 percent of them use
their phones at least occasionally while driving.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Maher noted that cell phones increase personal
safety and enhance communication between users and their family and
business associates. More than 36 million calls for emergency
services are placed annually with cell phones, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that education not legislation is the answer and we
are committed to enhancing public awareness of the dangers of
distraction and encouraging the responsible use of phones in
cars,'' Maher wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in at least one other municipality agree.
</P>
<P>
   West Paterson officials considered proposing a ban, but decided
instead to create a public education campaign on the dangers of
driving while talking on a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first towns in the nation to adopt a ban on using
cell phones while driving was Brooklyn, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Mary-Jo Banish, assistant clerk for the City Council there, said
about a dozen wireless companies opposed Brooklyn's ban. Some even
sent letters to customers, urging them to voice their opposition at
council meetings. No legal challenges have arisen, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Brooklyn's ban was enacted in March 1999, enforcement
did not begin until September. To date, 250 violators were issued
$3 summonses for their infractions.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is about safety, not collecting fines,'' said court clerk
Grace Musto.
