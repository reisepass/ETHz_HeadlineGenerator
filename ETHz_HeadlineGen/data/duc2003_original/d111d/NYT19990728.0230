   Two years ago, as Charles Finnie, an investment banker in San
Francisco, was driving home from work, he did what he did nearly
every time he got in the car: he picked up his cell phone and
started dialing. Eyes averted from the road, he slammed into the
car in front of him. No one was injured, but the impact jammed
Finnie's door shut. So he climbed out through the sun roof _ still
talking on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   The cell phone is maligned far and wide as an instrument not
just of rudeness but also of physical harm. People hear about it
emitting cancer-causing microwaves, disrupting pacemakers and
causing navigational confusion in airplanes. Just last week, an
airline passenger in Britain was sentenced to a year in prison for
endangering a flight by refusing to switch off his mobile phone.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate with the most momentum these days is the one
surrounding cell phones as potential driving hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Phoning while driving has been banned in several countries,
including Israel, Spain, Brazil and parts of Australia. After a
Japanese study found that the number of traffic accidents related
to car phones increased by 11 percent in Japan from 1997 to 1998,
driving with a cell phone in hand was banned there, too.
</P>
<P>
   Recent fatal car accidents around the nation have been
attributed to drivers who were distracted because they were using
their mobile phones. Last March, Brooklyn, Ohio, a Cleveland
suburb, made it illegal to use a cell phone handset while driving,
and the phones are now off-limits to New York cabdrivers.
</P>
<P>
   The concern is understandable. Anyone who has reached for a
ringing cell phone or dialed while at the steering wheel knows the
phones are distracting. The question is whether they pose such a
danger that they should be banished from drivers' hands.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Cellular Telecommunications Industry
Association, a trade group in Washington, there are nearly 77
million cell phones in use in the United States, and a new customer
signs up every 1.25 seconds. A 1997 survey by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration found that nearly 9 out of 10 cell
telephone owners used them at least occasionally while driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very rapidly moving field,'' said Mark Burris, a
research associate at the Center for Urban Transportation Research
at the University of South Florida in Tampa, which recently
released a report on cell phone use by drivers. ``The rapid
decrease in cost of a cell phone means a lot more people have
access to them, and a lot of people are driving. Put the two
together and this could be a major problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Cell phones in the car are, of course, a distraction like many
others. Reaching for a cell phone is no different, really, than
stretching for a cassette, unwrapping a cheeseburger or turning
around to scold a child. But the public image of many cell phone
users _ as pushy, self-important multitaskers _ highlights the
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Several studies have examined the potential hazards of talking
on a cell phone while driving. The one most widely cited was
conducted by researchers at the University of Toronto and published
in The New England Journal of Medicine in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   While pointing out that cellular telephones could be used in
emergencies to summon help (eventually they will all be able to
report their locations as well), enhancing drivers' safety, the
study concluded that talking on a cell phone while driving was as
dangerous as driving while at the threshold of legal intoxication.
That is, the risk of a collision when using a cell phone was found
to be four times as high as the risk when a cell phone was not
being used.
</P>
<P>
   An author of the study, Dr. Donald Redelmeier, a professor of
medicine at the University of Toronto, said it was the distraction
of the conversation itself, not the act of dialing or holding the
phone, that accounted for most of the increased risk. For that
reason, hands-free phones do not solve the problem and may even
worsen it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Having a hands-free phone, Redelmeier said, ``might lull drivers
into a false sense of security and encourage them to make calls
they might otherwise have avoided.''
</P>
<P>
   Corroborating Redelmeier's conclusion, other studies point out
that most accidents occur while drivers are in the middle of
conversations, not while they are dialing or answering calls.
</P>
<P>
   The increased risk persisted ``even among those drivers who'd
owned a cell phone over many years,'' Redelmeier said. ``It's not
inexperience, but perhaps a more fundamental limitation of driving
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Like others who have taken a hard look at cell phones in cars,
Redelmeier was inspired by a personal experience. ``I was in my
office at the end of the day returning phone calls and caught up
with a patient on his cell phone,'' he recalled. ``We were talking
and then he said, `I've got to stop talking _ I've just been in an
accident.'''
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured, Redelmeier said, but the incident started
him thinking about the role he may have played in the accident.
``It certainly made me think about whether having a conversation
with his personal physician distracted him and caused the
accident,'' he said. ``It brought new sting to the cliche of
`physician, do no harm.'''
</P>
<P>
   Findings like Redelmeier's have received widespread attention
but have had little effect on legislation so far.
</P>
<P>
   In several states, bills have been introduced, then have
fizzled. Mike Pugh, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol,
said the cellular communications industry was too strong in his
state for such legislation to win approval. And legislators are
also enamored of the technology, Pugh pointed out. ``They'll be in
the same room, on their phones, talking to each other from across
the room,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New York state has legislation pending to address the problem.
Assemblyman Felix Ortiz, a Democrat from Brooklyn, is the sponsor
of several bills related to cell phones being considered in Albany.
He said he had introduced his legislation after witnessing an
accident involving a cell phone. ``It is completely seriously
dangerous to drive and talk at the same time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the Cellular Telecommunications Industry
Association, the industry's main lobbying arm, see no reason to
single out cell phones as a safety hazard. ``Everything in the car
is a distraction,'' said the association's president, Tom Wheeler.
Wheeler said it was more important to educate drivers on using cell
phones safely, just as they learn other aspects of safe driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make a judgment that no, you're not going to push
down on that accelerator and make it through the yellow light, or
decide this is not the right time to have some sort of heated
conversation on a cell phone or dial the phone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Association officials pointed out that the Toronto study had
been criticized because even though it used cell phone records to
correlate accident times with calls, it was unclear whether the
calls had been made immediately before or after the accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on the use of cell phones by drivers say studies will be
more reliable if accident reports are changed to include a specific
place for a police officer to indicate whether a mobile phone was a
factor in a crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our recommendation is that all the states change their
accident reporting forms to include whether a cell phone may have
been in use or even the cause of the accident,'' said Burris, of
the University of South Florida. ``That way we'd have nationwide
data to use in the coming years so that legislation can be based on
sound accident analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Because more detailed information is needed, a spokesman for the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said, the agency is
preparing to conduct its own research on cell phones and other
distractions for drivers. ``I'm not sure we could ever legislate
attentiveness to driving,'' said the agency's administrator, Dr.
Ricardo Martinez. ``But when you put things into vehicles, you
should focus on how you design it.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he was concerned about what he called the emerging
e-car. ``Cars are becoming mobile computers, with GPS and weather
information and voice-activated e-mail,'' he said, making a
reference to the Global Positioning Satellite system. ``All these
things are more and more going to affect a driver's mental
distraction. We need to make sure that these devices actually
enhance the driving experience and don't drive us to distraction.''
