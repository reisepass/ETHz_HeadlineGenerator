   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton expressed sympathy to Israel
Friday after a car-bomb explosion in a Jerusalem market wounded 24
people but said the attack should not derail the recent
land-for-security deal between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The president said the accord that he helped mediate last month
was ``the best way to safety for the Israelis, the best way to
achieve the aspirations of the Palestinians and, in the end, the
only answer to Friday's act of criminal terror.''
</P>
<P>
   Two suicide bombers died in the attack in Jerusalem, which
appeared to be an effort to undermine the Wye agreement, named for
the Maryland conference center where the settlement was reached
last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Prime Minister Netanyahu and Chairman Arafat signed the
Wye River agreement, they knew they would face this moment,'' the
president said, interrupting a bill signing ceremony at the White
House to discuss the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew when they went home, both of them would be under
more danger and that terrorists would target innocent civilians;
they knew they would have to muster a lot of courage in their
people,'' he said, expressing ``my sympathy to the people of
Israel, who this morning were once again the target of a vicious
terrorist attack.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No nation should live under the threat of violence and terror
that they live under every day,'' he said. ``I ask for your prayers
and support today for the Israelis and the Palestinians who believe
in this agreement and who are determined to carry out their
responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Wye accord, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of
Israel agreed to relinquish a further 13 percent of the West Bank,
and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, promised to crack down
on Palestinian terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
had telephoned Netanyahu to express her condolences and to urge him
to move quickly, despite the violence, to carry out the agreement
reached with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The latest terrorist attack prompted the Israeli Cabinet to
delay further consideration of the agreement, a decision that
Albright said was appropriate as long as it was temporary. ``It is
customary for there to be a short pause in the wake of this kind of
attack,'' she said at a news conference after speaking with
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   But she added: ``It is important for the Israeli Cabinet to
resume its deliberations quickly. I believe, based on my
conversations with the prime minister, that he wants to find a way
to do this.''
