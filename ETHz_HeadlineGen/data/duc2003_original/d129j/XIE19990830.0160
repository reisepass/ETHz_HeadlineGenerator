MANILA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada underscored Monday the need to step up efforts to
strengthen the country's defense system against the so-called
millennium bug or Y2K.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that the Y2K problem should not get in
the way of the country's national efforts to be economically
stable and globally competitive in the world market.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the country's Y2K Commission, Estrada said all
sectors of society should do their share to avoid any possible
glitch in the computer system.
</P>
<P>
He also proclaimed the month of September as "Y2K Consciousness
Month."
</P>
<P>
While the government and the private sector are making dramatic
strides in the fight against the millennium bug, the president
said, there are still a lot more to be done.
</P>
<P>
Based on the latest report, the president said the finance
sector is already 93 percent prepared for the Y2K, utilities at 77
percent, telecommunications at 77 percent, and government services
at 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the president expressed confidence that through the Y2K
Commission's collective efforts the country shall "greet the year
2000 in better shape than other nations."
</P>
<P>
The Y2K Commission, set up a year ago, was tasked to address
the potential damage the millennium bug may inflict on the
economic well-being and security of the nation.
</P>
<P>
On June 1, the president signed into a law which empowers the
Y2K Commission to require government agencies, private companies,
associations and individuals to disclose their Y2K compliance
status and their contingency plans.
