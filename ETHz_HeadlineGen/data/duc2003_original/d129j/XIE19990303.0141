MANILA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Year 2000 (Y2K) Asian regional
coordinators Wednesday signed a historic Y2K declaration that will
lay down the framework for the region's approach to the millennium
bug debacle as the Second Global Y2K Summit was closed here.
</P>
<P>
The Declaration of Cooperation and Support of Asian Y2K
Coordinators summarized the priorities of action which will be
implemented by the regional coordinators in the Asia Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
The regional coordinators agreed to work together and intensify
efforts in sharing information across borders on Y2K issues and
minimizing adverse Y2K effects on vital sectors.
</P>
<P>
They called on the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and
other financial and multilateral organizations to review and
increase their level of support for national and regional Y2K
efforts.
</P>
<P>
The declaration, the world's first to be executed by regional
Y2K coordinators, will further strengthen Asia's link with other
international coordinators through the Washington-based
International Y2K Cooperation Center.
</P>
<P>
Amable Aguiluz, chairman of the Philippine Commission on Y2K
Compliance, said at the closing ceremony of the summit that Asian
coordinators agreed that the Y2K bug is "not a mere technical
problem but is a social management problem."
</P>
<P>
If it is not addressed, it will adversely affect the delivery
of essential services in critical sectors including power,
telecommunications, finance, transport and health, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the three-day summit, Aguiluz said it has already achieved
its objectives of raising awareness on the Y2K problem and
exchanging information and views among experts.
