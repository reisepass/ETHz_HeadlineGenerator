   HOUSTON _ As Year 2000 problems surface, a wave of litigation is
expected to flood the courts and keep lawyers swimming for years.
</P>
<P>
   But with careful representation of Y2K preparations, companies
can stay out of court.
</P>
<P>
   One year before the millennium bug reveals its strength, 39 Y2K
lawsuits already have been filed, according to the Information
Technology Association of America, which maintains a database.
</P>
<P>
   Most lawsuits have been directed at software vendors who haven't
offered solutions for Y2K glitches, but the first lawsuit, filed in
August 1997, was brought against a company whose cash registers
crashed whenever they processed a credit card with a ``00''
expiration date.
</P>
<P>
   After Jan. 1, 2000, lawyers say a wide range of corporate
defendants will face breach of contract, fraud, product liability,
personal injury and shareholder suits for products or operations
that failed because of Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, law firms in Houston and across the nation are
building Y2K practice groups. Vinson &AMP; Elkins has a Y2K practice
group of 40 to 50 lawyers. The Y2K team at Bracewell &AMP; Patterson
has been working with banks for several years on Y2K issues. Baker
&AMP; Botts' Y2K network has been advising corporate clients on
disclosure issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last six months, it seems like everybody and their
brother has formed a Y2K practice group,'' said Vito Peraino,
chairman of a 12-lawyer practice group at the California firm
Hancock, Rothert &AMP; Bunshoft, which maintains a Web site tracking
Y2K legal filings.
</P>
<P>
   After the turn of the century, the millennium bug will cost $497
billion in litigation, damages and recovery damages, said Capers
Jones, author of ``The Year 2000 Software Problem'' and chief
scientist at Massachusetts consulting firm Software Productivity
Research.
</P>
<P>
   Jones estimates that $100 billion of that total will be straight
litigation costs, but that proportion may rise because companies
don't appear to be spending enough now to prevent problems later.
</P>
<P>
   Moves are afoot to minimize legal entanglements. In October,
President Clinton signed the Year 2000 Information and Readiness
Disclosure Act, which said that companies can't be sued for
disclosures about their Y2K readiness.
</P>
<P>
   But some lawyers and legislators say Y2K litigation reform
didn't go far enough. Vinson &AMP; Elkins advises clients to sign
confidentiality agreements with each other before disclosing their
Y2K preparedness in case the law doesn't provide enough protection,
partner Clark Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, state senators Robert Duncan and Troy Fraser and Rep.
Brian McCall hope to introduce legislation before the Legislature
convenes Jan. 12. The Year 2000 Working Group bill would create a
window in which the defendant must try to solve the problem before
the claimant can sue, encourage sellers to make repairs and notify
buyers of upgrades, narrow the statute of limitations on claims,
limit reliance on representations of Y2K compliance, and limit
damages.
</P>
<P>
   Others see mediation and arbitration as the answer. The CPR
Institute for Dispute Resolution in New York has assembled a panel
of 77 lawyers to mediate in Y2K disputes. Nineteen global companies
and their subsidiaries, including Bank of America, General Mills
and Sony Electronics, have pledged to submit to alternative dispute
resolution to solve Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y2K problems are just that: problems to be solved. The
I-win-you-lose of the courts don't lend themselves to
problem-solving,'' said James F. Henry, president of CPR Institute
for Dispute Resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Making Y2K preparations is the best defense against ending up in
court, Y2K lawyers say. A company can buck a negligence charge by
making reasonable preparations to solve the problem and adhering to
standard industry practices for confronting Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Zembek, an attorney with Fulbright &AMP; Jaworski, offered
this advice to participants in a Y2K seminar sponsored by the Texas
Manufacturing Assistance Center in November:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Y2K committee: A company should have a committee to
spearhead Y2K preparation efforts. The committee must be empowered
to take steps to solve the problem, have the support of senior
management, and have the time and financial resources to tackle the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   _ Documentation: The Y2K committee should have a clear and
consistent plan about how it plans to document the company's Y2K
efforts. A company should carefully document the steps it has taken
to solve the problem, but keep e-mails calling the boss a blockhead
for not minding the committee's recommendations out of the file.
Juries don't look kindly upon shredding, deleting or omitting
records, so companies should be consistent and complete.
</P>
<P>
   _ Attorney-client privilege: A company may want to invite its
corporate counsel to some of the Y2K planning meetings if it wants
to invoke attorney-client privilege over some of its Y2K
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Representation: No one will know for sure if their Y2K efforts
solved the problem until Jan. 1, 2000, so a company should not
claim that it is ``Y2K compliant.'' A company should come up with
its own definition about what it means to be Y2K ready, and then
fill it. Look up technology company Web sites for ideas about
wording the definition.
</P>
<P>
   _ Communication: The Y2K committee should update employees with
a simple, clear message about what the company is doing. When a
customer asks a salesperson about what the company is doing about
the Y2K problem, the salesperson should know what to say.
