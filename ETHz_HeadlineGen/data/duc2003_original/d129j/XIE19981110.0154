HONG KONG, November 10 (Xinhua) -- There has been a significant
improvement in the awareness of the Year 2000 Problem (Y2K) among
Hong Kong companies, a survey conducted by the Hong Kong
Productivity Council (HKPC) showed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In September 1998, the Council interviewed 3,065 local
companies through telephone on the Impact of the Y2K in Hong Kong.
Some 98.3 percent of the respondents said they had heard about Y2K
while 77.5 percent claimed that they knew what it is.
</P>
<P>
Compared with a similar study conducted by HKPC in 1997 in
which nearly 40 percent of the respondents had never heard of Y2K,
the latest findings reflected a remarkable increase in the Y2K
awareness level.
</P>
<P>
The study was endorsed by the government's Information
Technology and Broadcasting Bureau and supported by the Industry
Department.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the findings of the study, Thomas Tang, executive
director of HKPC, said, in spite of an improvement in Y2K
awareness in the business sector, local companies, in particular,
small and medium-sized enterprises, are still facing a lot of
problems in tackling Y2K, mainly due to lack of financial and
manpower resources.
</P>
<P>
The study shows that the size of the companies is directly
proportional to the amount of preparation they undertake toward
solving the Y2K problem. Among those who believe they will be
affected by Y2K but with no plan to tackle it, over half are
companies with less than four staff and 40 percent with five to 19
staff.
</P>
<P>
To help small and medium-sized enterprises combat the
millennium bug, HKPC launched Tuesday an 888 Bug-Buster Program,
an on-site Y2K rectification service for local companies at the
affordable price of 888 HK dollars (114 U.S. dollars).
