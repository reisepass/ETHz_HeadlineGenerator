   GLENMONT, N.Y. _ Y2K came to church last September.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Pastor Steve Lalor of the Emmanuel Christian Church
was simply talking to his flock about the threat of Year 2000
computer-related problems. Next thing he knew, a dozen members of
the church were holding classes on canning, gardening and drying
food.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are preparing for Y2K by moving to the country and
buying generators and guns. But in the Capital Region and around
the country, many are doing the opposite. In churches, in schools
on campus or in private homes, rather than causing panic, the
threat of trouble on New Year's, 2000, is bringing people together.
</P>
<P>
   Community meetings about Y2K are happening everywhere:
</P>
<P>
   _ Last week, the University at Albany held a two-day Y2K
conference for students, staff and the community.
</P>
<P>
   _ In March, 150 people attended a PTA meeting about Y2K in
Glenmont.
</P>
<P>
   _ A bed and breakfast in New Lebanon is holding a daylong Y2K
discussion for anyone who wants to come.
</P>
<P>
   _ A regional Y2K interest group has seen its members soar from
less than 20 to more than 50, and is now looking for a larger place
to meet.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Lalor's church, which is holding a Y2K day-long
seminar Tuesday, April 20, to talk about generators, stocking up on
food and other issues. The public, of course, is invited.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not living in fear of Y2K,'' said Lalor. ``We're just
saying we need to be ready.'' ``Y2K'' is the name given to the risk
of computer programs failing due to the inability to accept the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Problems have been found in both large computers and tiny
computer chips. Although corporate America is spending tens of
billions of dollars to fix the problem, some believe Y2K issues
could cause power outages, food and gas shortages and possibly even
an economic depression.
</P>
<P>
   Much of America seems to be taking Y2K in stride. And while some
advocates say Y2K's biggest concern is last-minute panic, the
possibility of that seems increasingly remote as the issue is
discussed.
</P>
<P>
   After all, some say, how can people panic when they've known
about something for a year? That's why experts like Peter de Jager,
a computer programmer who was one of the first people to tell the
world about the Y2K issue, recently said Y2K problems won't be
likely since so many people are paying attention to it.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for all of the doom and gloom, in some ways Y2K is
almost a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really is a community thing,'' said Victor Porlier, a
local author who wrote the book ``Y2K: An Action Plan'' and has
lectured on Y2K here and around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, it is a source of civic renewal,'' he said.
``We're all talking about how hyper-sped our lives are. Here, in
small little ways, you've got people having reason to talk to
neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   From Lalor's point of view, it's the church's role to inform its
parishoners about potential disasters. About half of Emmanuel
Christian Church's 60 members are preparing for Y2K by stocking up
on food or other items, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And about a dozen have attended a series of evening meetings to
talk about simple living (AKA: post Y2K-disaster living). They've
learned how to build a garden, how to can and dry food and how to
make bread from scratch. And they may store some food in the church
itself. Lalor has also been in touch with other churches in an
effort to spread the word.
</P>
<P>
   A few towns away, more than 150 people came to the
Berne-Knox-Westerlo High School on a weekday night to hear author
Porlier speak about Y2K. The question-and-answers lasted longer
than anyone expected.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation was brought about by the local PTA, in
conjunction with the district superintendent, who also attended.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came in skeptical. They left believing,'' said PTA
Co-President Janet Finke, who recommended parents leave their kids
at home so all this talk about Y2K disasters wouldn't scare them.
</P>
<P>
   After Porlier finished, a number of locals gave information on
their own. An insurance expert talked about how few insurance
companies cover Y2K-related problems.
</P>
<P>
   A generator salesman told everyone to buy one now if they wanted
one, because they are selling quick.
