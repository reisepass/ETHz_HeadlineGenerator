	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's conservatives won a decisive victory
in elections for a clergy-based assembly that oversees the
country's supreme leader, official results showed Sunday.
	   The results were expected since most moderates had been dropped
from the ballot in advance of Friday's election by a council that
reviews candidates's eligibility and is dominated by hard-liners.
	   The hard-liners won at least 54 places on the 86-seat Assembly
of Experts and the moderates only 13.
	   Sixteen seats went to candidates whose political affiliation was
unclear _ but who probably lean toward the hard-line camp _ and
three to declared independents, who are believed to be closer to
the moderates.
	   The outcome is a blow to moderates who had hoped to use the
Assembly of Experts to curb the absolute powers of the supreme
leader and broaden social and political freedoms for the average
Iranian.
	   In the capital, Tehran, moderate former President Hashemi
Rafsanjani led the polls with 1,682,882 votes. Behind him was
hard-liner Ali Meshkini, the current head of the Assembly of
Experts, with 1,240,524 votes.
	   Hard-liners won 11 of the 16 seats in Tehran and moderates only
five. Among the hard-liners who won in the capital were Mohammad
Yazdi, head of the powerful judiciary, and Ahmad Jannati, who leads
the council that vetted the candidates.
	   The results showed that only about 18 million of the 38.5
million eligible voters had bothered to cast ballots.
	   The official media had reported crowded polling stations and a
massive turnout, but visits to Tehran stations showed many nearly
empty and calls to other parts of the country produced similar
reports.
	   Many Iranians said they stayed away to protest the dropping of
most progressive theologians by the conservative-dominated Council
of Guardians. The council reviewed a list of 396 applicants and
allowed only 167 to run.
	   Friday's voter turnout was in sharp contrast to last year's
presidential elections, when some 30 million cast ballots, 20
million of whom voted for President Mohammad Khatami, who has
presented the biggest challenge to the conservatives since the 1979
Islamic revolution.
	   Some moderate leaders had said in advance they did not expect to
win the balloting but still hoped to use the assembly to focus on
the growing powers granted to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, the country's top Shiite Muslim cleric.
	   The hard-liners want to maintain Khamenei's absolute authority
and have battled Khatami's efforts to grant more freedom to the
press and the arts and reduce Islamic strictures on the average
citizen.
