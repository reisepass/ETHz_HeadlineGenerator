	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's flood control headquarters sent an urgent
appeal to soldiers and civilians already worn down from a
summer-long battle against floods, urging them Sunday to keep up
the fight.
	   Another flood crest rolled down the Yangtze River, China's
longest river. It has been hit by the heaviest flooding since 1954,
when more than 30,000 people were killed.
	   This year's floods have killed more than 3,000 people, 1,320 of
them along the 3,900-mile- (6,200-kilometer-) long Yangtze.
	   The latest flood crest, the eighth this summer, passed Chongqing
in southwest China, and waters were rising in Yichang, in central
China's Hubei province, on the middle reaches of the Yangtze, state
television reported Sunday.
	   Flood control officials urged the millions of people patrolling
important dikes along the river and on Dongting Lake to work hard
guarding danger points, People's Daily reported Sunday.
	   The dikes have been weakened and waterlogged after more than two
months of floods that have left millions of people homeless.
	   The floods since mid-June have affected 2.1 million hectares of
farmland nationwide, according to official figures.
	   Agriculture experts have been mobilized to advise farmers on how
to save late rice and cotton crops where waters have receded and to
provide seeds for cash crops to help farmers make up for lost
income, the China Daily reported.
	   In addition to the heavily populated Yangtze basin, China's
unusually heavy summer floods have struck on rivers in the
northeast and in Tibet.
	   After many years of rapid growth at the expense of the
environment, China is being forced by this year's severe flooding
to acknowledge the costs of environmental devastation.
	   Officials have pointed out that deforestation along the Yangtze
has worsened the flooding. With no trees to soak up the water, soil
erodes from hillsides and silts up river beds.
	   In addition, human encroachment on wetlands has reduced their
ability to absorb floodwaters.
	   In Tibet, floods have hit 40 of the region's more than 70
counties, destroying 2,000 houses, killing livestock and ruining
crops.
	   Major rivers in Tibet were at record levels, and forecasters
said more torrential rains were expected.
