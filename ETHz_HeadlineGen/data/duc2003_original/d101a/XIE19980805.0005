WUHAN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Flood control experts warned today
that flood situation along the Yangtze River remains grim despite
a favorable turn in the weather which has replaced torrential rain
in the middle and lower reaches of the river with sunshine.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rain in the upper reaches of the river will prolong
dangerously high water levels in the middle and lower reaches for
the foreseeable future, according to Ji Xuewu, director of the
Hydrological Department under the Yangtze River Water Conservancy
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan and surrounding areas in Hubei Province face the threat
of the heaviest flooding since 1954.
</P>
<P>
Water levels at the Shashi Hydrological Station in Jingzhou hit
43.94 meters by 08:00 this morning, some 0.94 meters above the
flood stage. The Jingzhou-Shashi areas is considered most
vulnerable section of Yangtze levees in Hubei Province. The third
flood crest is expected to raise water levels at the Shishou
Station to 40.2 meters, slightly higher than the record 39.91
meters through.
</P>
<P>
Ji noted that if the precipitation levels in the middle and
lower reaches of Hanjiang River, a tributary of the Yangtze,
exceed 60 mm, the water discharge rate at Wuhan will reach more
than 5,000 cu.m./second, and this will cause greater flood control
difficulties in the transportation and business hub which has a
population of over seven million people. The current discharge
rate stands at 2,600 cu.m./second.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River Flood Control Headquarters has issued a
circular instructing provinces in the middle and lower reaches of
the river to prepare emergency evacuation plans.
