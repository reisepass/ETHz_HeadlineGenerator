CHANGSHA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Big floods are still possible in
the Yangtze River valley this summer, especially in the middle and
upper reaches.
</P>
<P>
The warning came from Li Antian, director of the Yangtze River
Water Resources Committee (YRWRC), who said there is a high
probability that the upper river valley will experience bigger
floods than last year.
</P>
<P>
There has been little rainfall in the Yangtze River valley
since last winter and many experts predict that when it comes it
will be concentrated during the flood season this year, according
to experts at a recent meeting on flood control.
</P>
<P>
Jin Xingping, deputy chief engineer of the hydrology bureau
under the YRWRC, predicted that the highest water level of the
mainstream and tributary of the Yangtze, the longest river in
China, will be higher this year than that in the previous years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the possible increase in the number of typhoons in
the lower reaches will add to the possibility of big floods this
year.
</P>
<P>
Nie Rongfang, senior engineer with the Hunan Provincial Water
Resources Department, has called that regions in the valley should
be fully prepared for the possible disaster.
</P>
<P>
Local governments along the river have been asked to complete
anti-flood projects as quickly as possible.
