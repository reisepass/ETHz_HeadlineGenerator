BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Flooding on the Yangtze River
remains serious although water levels on parts of the river
decreased today, according to the State Headquarters of Flood
Control and Drought Relief.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River water level at a measuring point in
Chongqing, in the upper reaches, hit 180 meters at 2 p.m. today,
which is as high as the official danger mark.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, water levels at several measuring points on
the middle and lower reaches have declined slightly. In Shashi,
upstream of Wuhan, capital of central Hubei Province, the water
level has gone down to 43.9 meters, 0.04 meters lower than Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wang Maolin, secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the
Communist Party of China, said that flooding at Dongting Lake, one
of China's three major lakes, has increased though the sixth flood
crest of the Yangtze smoothly passed through Chenglingji on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The lake's water level measured at Chenglingji stood as high as
35.87 meters at 8 a.m. today, which is just 0.07 meters lower than
the all-time high created by the sixth flood crest, according to
an official news release.
</P>
<P>
The embankments of Dongting Lake and the part of the Yangtze
River running through Hunan have been seriously damaged, as they
have been soaked in high levels of water for nearly one month,
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
At least 37 trouble spots, including 12 major ones, occurred
Friday in Yueyang City, which is within the lake area, according
to Wang.
</P>
<P>
"Though the flood crest has passed, there is no sight of the
floods easing," Wang said, urging anti-flood workers to remain
sober-minded.
</P>
<P>
Late tonight, some 830,000 soldiers and civilians were still
battling against floods in Yueyang alone.
</P>
<P>
The sixth flood crest of the Yangtze River entered Jiujiang, in
eastern Jiangxi Province, at 8 a.m. on Wednesday and is still
gradually passing through the city. More than 300,000 troops of
the People's Liberation Army and armed police are working together
with local residents to defend the major embankments along the
Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River's water level at Jiujiang stood at 22.46
meters at 2 p.m. today. Experts say that the sixth flood crest of
the Yangtze will have completely passed through Jiujiang by Sunday
afternoon. The flow-back of the Yangtze River's floodwaters into
Poyang Lake extended the length of time for the flood crest to
pass through the city. The experts say the decline of the Yangtze
River's water level should accelerate in the next two days if
there is no heavy rain in the river valley.
</P>
<P>
In east China's Jiangsu Province, on the lower reaches of the
Yangtze River, more than 800,000 troops and civilians are ready
to fight against possible floods resulting from the expected
arrival of the river's sixth flood crest on Sunday or Monday.
