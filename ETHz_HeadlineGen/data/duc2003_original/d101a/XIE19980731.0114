WUHAN, July 31 (Xinhua) -- This year's serious swelling of the
Yangtze River has been caused by abnormal movement of the rain
front in the areas along the middle and lower reaches of the
river, according to a senior Chinese hydrologist.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jun, a senior engineer with the Hydrological Bureau of the
Yangtze River Water Control Committee, said due to the abnormal
movement of the rain front, the rainy season has remained longer
than usual in the valley along the middle and lower reaches of the
Yangtze. Consequently, torrential rains simultaneously hit most of
the valley, bringing the floods to the Yangtze River valley.
</P>
<P>
The major floods of 1931 and 1954 were of the same type as this
year's, said Wang. But the floods on the Yangtze in 1935 and 1981
belongs to a different type, caused by concentrated torrential
rains in particular regions, and causing floods on the river
within those regions.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, flood waters on the middle and lower reaches
of the Yangtze mostly come from areas upstream from Yichang City
where a gigantic water control dam is being constructed.
</P>
<P>
As the flood-discharging capacity of the region's rivers are
limited, the valley along the middle and lower reaches has become
a key region for flood-control efforts.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Yangtze River Water Control Committee show
that embankments with a total length of about 40,000 kilometers
have been constructed along the main stream of the Yangtze and its
many tributaries to hold back swollen rivers.
</P>
<P>
Included among the embankments are 3,500-kilometer-long dikes
built along the main stream of the middle and lower reaches of the
Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
While preventing floods, it is equally important to combat
waterlogging in harnessing the Yangtze River valley, said Luo
Xulu, another senior engineer with the same Yangtze River Water
Control Committee.
</P>
<P>
According to Luo, about 4.67 million hectares of farmland are
prone to waterlogging in the Yangtze River valley, 93 percent of
which are in the plains and the many cities situated along the
middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Many provinces along the Yangtze have been affected by this
year's floods which began in June, inundating a vast farmland
area. Many cities were waterlogged because of limited water
drainage facilities.
</P>
<P>
The fundamental task for combating waterlogging in the Yangtze
River valley is to improve the drainage capacity of flooded fields
by working out appropriate standards and plans in accordance with
the specific features of the waterlogged areas, said Luo.
