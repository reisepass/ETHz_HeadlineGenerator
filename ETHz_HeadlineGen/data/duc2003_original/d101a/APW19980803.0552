CLARIFIES that embankments are on Yangtze in graf 7 &QL;

	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's military has ordered soldiers to ``fight
to the death'' to ensure that waterlogged dikes holding back the
flooded Yangtze River do not collapse, state media reported Monday.
	   More than 1 million soldiers, militiamen and reservists have
been drafted into flood control efforts in four provinces in south
and east China as flood levels on the Yangtze reached levels unseen
in more than four decades.
	   China's military, the world's largest, with 2.9 million members,
has played a prominent role in efforts to prevent the collapse of
embankments that protect millions of people and rich farmland along
the river, the world's third-longest.
	   Floods brought by rains that fell earlier and heavier than usual
have killed at least 1,268 people in China so far this year.
	   Most of the deaths have occurred along the Yangtze, but
authorities in northern China warned Monday that heavy rains could
also cause catastrophic flooding along the Yellow River.
	   Sandbags and other supplies have been stockpiled and 2.5 million
people alerted to fight high waters if they come, the official
Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   Hundreds of thousands of flood victims living in lean-tos on top
of Yangtze embankments for the past six weeks may have to wait
three weeks more, until waters subside, before returning home, said
Arne Jacobsen, a Red Cross official who recently toured flooded
areas.
	   Exhaustion and exposure are wearing down flood victims' health
and they also are beginning to show symptoms of mental strain, he
said.
	   Thus far, diseases have been confined to intestinal complaints
and skin infections from contact with dirty water, said Jacobsen.
Free antibiotics and water purification pills are running out in
some areas, though they remained available for sale in shops, he
added.
	   Commanders in the Nanjing Military Region, in flood-battered
Jiangsu province east of Shanghai, ordered all officers and men to
``fight to the death to protect the Yangtze River dikes, major
cities along the river and the well-being and property of local
people,'' the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   Speedy work by 500 soldiers on collapsed dikes near the city of
Yueyang in southern Hunan province last week saved the lives and
property of 100,000 people, Xinhua said.
	   Another 800 soldiers worked ``tirelessly'' for five days and
nights to reinforce a levee on Hunan's Dongting lake, which flows
into the Yangtze. Army planes, boats and trucks have ferried 160
tons of food, clothing, medicine and plastic sheeting to stricken
areas, Xinhua said.
	   Meanwhile, a man who refused to join anti-flood efforts and
attacked a village official, and another who allegedly dumped four
truck loads of soil into a river, were arrested in Jiangsu, Xinhua
said.
