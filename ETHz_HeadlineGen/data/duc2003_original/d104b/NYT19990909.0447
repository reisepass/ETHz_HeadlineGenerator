   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Sept. 10:
</P>
<P>
   The naming of former Sen. John Danforth to conduct an
independent inquiry into the FBI's disastrous 1993 siege of the
Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, is a promising
development. The need for such an inquiry has been obvious from the
moment the FBI acknowledged, after six years of firm denials by the
agency and Attorney General Janet Reno, that it had used incendiary
tear-gas canisters during the siege.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, R-Mo., has a strong background in law enforcement and
a reputation among his former Capitol Hill colleagues for balance
and honesty. His congressional record was blemished by his overly
zealous defense of Judge Clarence Thomas during the tumultuous
Supreme Court confirmation hearings in 1991. Danforth at the time
seemed more interested in painting Anita Hill as a possible
psychopath than getting to the bottom of her accusations of sexual
harassment by Thomas. A lot now rides on Danforth's ability and
determination, in his new role, to avoid the lack of objectivity
that marked his performance in that regrettable episode.
</P>
<P>
   We believe he will be able to do so. At a news conference
Thursday, Danforth correctly identified the two key questions his
investigation needs to answer. Was there a cover-up, and did the
actions by federal officials in deploying the tear gas canisters
result in the conflagration in which about 80 people died? The
evidence made public so far does not refute the government's
contention that the blaze was set by the cultists themselves. But
the official version needs to be rigorously tested in light of the
damage to public confidence when key evidence in FBI files gets
overlooked and the American people are misinformed by the FBI
director and the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   As for this week's call by the Senate majority leader, Trent
Lott, and others for Reno's resignation, we sympathize with the
sentiment. Her initial decision to attack the compound was rash,
and Lott is correct in saying that her credibility has been badly
undermined by the six-year lag in disclosing key evidence about the
debacle contained in FBI files. Her failure to fully investigate
campaign finance abuses by the Clinton administration was a
flagrant dereliction of duty. But for the sake of getting to the
bottom of the Waco mess, it is far better now to have Reno remain
in office and therefore subject to public and Congressional
pressure to cooperate fully with Danforth's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Danforth has taken the job, Congress should put off its
own investigations to avoid any harmful interference with his
inquiry. That is the responsible course chosen by the chairman of
the House Judiciary Committee, Henry Hyde. It would be helpful for
other would-be investigators in the House and Senate to follow his
lead.
