   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, July 25:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Danforth noted last Friday that his inquiry into the 1993
Waco disaster had been limited to ``whether government agents had
engaged in bad acts, not whether they exercised bad judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   This is an important distinction. The report by Danforth, the
special counsel, cleared Attorney General Janet Reno of any
wrongdoing in the federal raid on the compound near Waco, Texas,
occupied by a sect called the Branch Davidians. After a 51-day
standoff, tanks driven by FBI agents pumped tear gas into the
compound, after which a fire broke out, claiming about 80 lives.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that the agents had not shot at the cult
members or started the fire, as many critics of the government's
behavior have long asserted. At the same time, however, the report
did not address the question whether Reno had been right to order
the assault, which we continue to believe was a reckless move.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth rebuked the government on other grounds, mainly its
failure to tell the truth about the use of incendiary tear gas
canisters. Indeed, it was the disclosure that FBI agents, despite
repeated denials and without telling Reno, had fired such devices
that prompted the investigation. According to Danforth the
canisters were launched hours before the fire, landed harmlessly 75
feet from the Branch Davidians' living quarters and did not cause
the fire. Nevertheless Danforth, who described his investigation as
``95 percent complete,'' said the remaining work would focus on why
Congress was never told about the canisters, a failure that
``undermined public confidence in government.''
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, Reno and the country have reason to be reassured
by the report, which seems to put to rest what Danforth called
``the dark questions'' _ whether the government had conspired to
wipe out the Branch Davidians and whether it later engaged in a
cover-up. Danforth's team of 56 lawyers and investigators answered
no on both counts, placing responsibility for the fire and for the
deaths of the cult members squarely on David Koresh, the sect's
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the tragedy need not have happened at all. The one
thing the FBI agents always had on their side was time. Reno went
along with the FBI's assault proposals partly on grounds, never
substantiated, that children were being sexually abused inside the
compound. The agents should have been ordered to starve the cult
out and hold the tanks and tear gas. Koresh might still have
orchestrated the same suicidal endgame, but the country would have
been spared years of doubts about the wisdom and integrity of its
government.
