   WASHINGTON _ The FBI released a new videotape Friday in which a
federal agent describes the use of incendiary tear gas grenades
during the 1993 assault on the Branch Davidian compound near Waco,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, the military gas did not penetrate that, uh, bunker
where the bus was,'' reports Charlie One, an agent inside a Bradley
fighting vehicle. ``It bounced off.''
</P>
<P>
   A transcript of the conversation on the infrared videotape
provides graphic evidence of what federal officials had denied for
six years until recently _ that military-issue CS tear gas, which
uses an incendiary device to disperse the contents, was used in the
April 19, 1993, assault that ended with the deaths of Branch
Davidian leader David Koresh and 75 of his followers, including 21
children.
</P>
<P>
   The new transcript also supports the FBI's assertion that the
grenades hit a bunker consisting of concrete poured around a buried
bus that was well away from the wooden compound where the Branch
Davidians died in the blaze that erupted several hours later.
</P>
<P>
   The videotape and transcript were released shortly after
Attorney General Janet Reno said that she and FBI Director Louis
Freeh were very close to naming an independent investigator into
the FBI's handling of the Waco matter.
</P>
<P>
   Reno also denied that any rift had formed between her and Freeh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past two weeks, I, along with many Americans, have
been troubled, very troubled over what has transpired,'' said Reno.
``But Director Freeh and I are dedicated to finding the truth in
this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the FBI had released an initial videotape in which
permission to fire grenades is given by Richard M. Rogers, the
assistant special FBI agent in charge of the hostage rescue team.
On the second tape, the report comes back at 8:08 a.m. that the
first shot did not succeed.
</P>
<P>
   The agents then discuss moving into a better position. However,
the audio portion of the videotape ends before any further mention
of attempts to use the CS canisters, which can be shot from an M-79
grenade launcher. The FBI said the audio recording was stopped at
the request of a pilot.
</P>
<P>
   In her weekly meeting with reporters, Reno refused to comment on
reports that two highly respected former Republican senators, John
Danforth of Missouri and Warren Rudman of New Hampshire, are under
consideration to head the new Waco probe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to ensure that any individual has no conflicts, would
be well-received and has the time to handle the task in an
appropriate manner,'' said Reno. ``That is a lot to ask of any
individual, and it is appropriate to let any individual have the
time to think it over.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about reports of a rift between the Justice Department and
FBI, the attorney general said reports that U.S. marshals were
dispatched to seize Waco documents from FBI headquarters as a
public rebuke for the agency were ``just plain wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said her relationship with Freeh ``is one of the best
relationships that people can have in law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As we seek the truth, it's very important that people don't
play one off against another,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno made it clear that her orders were that no incendiary
devices were to be used in the Waco operation period _ making no
allowances for the concrete bunker that the FBI has admitted
hitting with the M-651 CS grenades.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I asked for were assurances _ and I received assurances _
that we would not use incendiary devices or pyrotechnic means of
delivering incendiary devices,'' said Reno. ``And I made no
distinction between any part of the compound.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Under the right circumstances, the M-651 CS grenades could cause
a fire, said Charles Cutshaw, an editor at Jane's Defense
Information Group and a retired U.S. Army intelligence officer.
</P>
<P>
   The canisters ``generate CS powder by burning, rather than
exploding,'' explained Cutshaw. he metal surface of the grenade
becomes ``hot to touch'' but probably not hot enough to cause a
fire if it landed on a wooden surface such as a table or floor.
</P>
<P>
   However, the ``incendiary process involved in generating the
CS'' could ignite ``flammable vapors such as gasoline,'' he said.
``It is akin to striking a match adjacent to the filling neck of a
gasoline tank.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said, ``We may find that this was not considered
incendiary. Other people indicate it may have been. Let us judge it
with an outside investigator so that we can see the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   But the attorney general maintained that the facts still
indicate that federal agents did not cause the fire at the Branch
Davidian complex.
</P>
<P>
   Reno sidestepped questions about whether she is angry at being
kept in the dark for six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is a matter of anger. This is a matter of
getting to the truth. And whatever I am, I am as dedicated as I
possibly can be to getting to the truth,'' said Reno. ``Sometimes
anger obscures the truth and so I try to do so as calmly and as
clearly as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she would resign, she replied, ``If the truth
shows I've done something wrong, then I will accept the
consequences.''
