	HOUSTON (AP) -- For years, filmmaker Michael McNulty accused the  
government of lying about its actions during the seven-week 
confrontation with Branch Davidians that ended in fiery tragedy in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally this week, after years of denials, the government  
admitted it did use pyrotechnic devices the day the Davidian's 
Mount Caramel compound burned down, killing David Koresh and about 
80 followers. 
</P>
<P>
	But while McNulty said he is gratified the truth is finally  
coming out -- he believes there is more that is yet to be revealed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting answers is satisfying, but it will be much more  
satisfying when the people who are responsible are in prison,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of this is not about Mike McNulty, or the films that have  
been done, or about selling the films. It's about finding the 
truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNulty's 1997 film, ``Waco: Rules of Engagement,'' is based on  
grainy, black and white videotape recorded by an FBI surveillance 
aircraft circling over the compound. It was nominated for an Oscar 
in 1998 for Best Documentary Feature. 
</P>
<P>
	The film suggests that after Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms  
agents botched the raid of Koresh's compound 10 miles east of Waco 
on Feb. 28, 1993, the FBI recklessly attacked the religious group 
50 days later, on April 19, with tank-driving commandos, intent on 
avenging the death of four agents. 
</P>
<P>
	The film cast doubt on Justice Department claims it used only  
non-burning grenades on April 19, 1993. McNulty said he found 
physical evidence to that effect -- one pyrotechnic shell and a 
photograph of another shell that had been misidentified -- more than 
a year after the movie's release. 
</P>
<P>
	The evidence will be included in the Fort Collins, Colo.,  
resident's second film, ``Waco: A New Revelation,'' to be released 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno, following a former FBI official's  
acknowledgment of the devices, said on Wednesday that the 
incendiaries were used and ordered a full investigation. Congress 
now says it also will investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American public has a right to know the truth,'' said  
Danny O. Coulson, the retired FBI assistant deputy director whose 
statements sparked Reno's admission. ``And we have an obligation to 
tell the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Coulson's statements to The Dallas Morning News that  
forced this week's admissions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas Rangers, custodians of the evidence through an  
arrangement with the federal government, earlier this year opened 
an inquiry into evidence identified by McNulty. 
</P>
<P>
	David Thibodeau, a former Koresh follower and one of nine siege  
survivors, said Friday that the latest revelations are ``things we 
were saying for years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People automatically just did believe what they were told  
because the government and certain members of the press did such a 
good job of demonizing the Branch Davidians,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case has attracted a cadre of researchers, experts and  
lawyers who consider themselves government watchdogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona attorney David Hardy has fought his battles through open  
records laws, repeatedly winning Freedom of Information lawsuits 
against agencies that denied him access to documents about the 
standoff. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, Hardy won $32,000 in attorney's fees -- the only  
financial remedy allowable in such suits -- after a judge ruled the 
FBI and ATF had ``stonewalled'' his requests. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's exhilarating because I've spent three years compiling  
these documents, and to finally have them all, in the space of a 
week, become useful is great,'' Hardy said of the new public 
scrutiny. ``We had to pry those documents away from the government 
one at a time.''
