   In Washington, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder issued a
statement praising Danforth's findings. ``Today's independent
review sheds further light on the truth, and discredits many of the
unsubstantiated allegations that have skewed the public's
perception of the events of April 19, 1993,'' Holder said. ``We
join Senator Danforth in wishing that this report begins the
process of restoring the faith of people in their government.''
</P>
<P>
   Holder said he was concerned about the findings that government
lawyers had withheld the information about the pyrotechnic rounds
but ``heartened'' that those rounds had not caused the fire. He
also said the report underscored the attorney general's ``diligent
efforts to learn the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis Freeh, the FBI director, said: ``The simple truth, as the
FBI has maintained since April 19, 1993, has been unmistakingly
confirmed again today. The FBI fired no shots on that day and the
Davidians started the fire that ultimately engulfed the compound.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Caddell, the lead lawyer for the Branch Davidians in the
wrongful death lawsuit, expressed disappointment with Danforth's
findings and found particular fault with his conclusion that
federal agents had not fired weapons. Next month, Caddell and
government lawyers will litigate that issue as a separate, but
related, part of the wrongful death lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said Danforth disregarded flaws in a special simulation
conducted in March to help discern if weapons were fired. The
simulation was intended to determine if flashes that appeared on an
aerial, infrared videotape filmed the day of the fire were caused
by gunfire. A British company hired by Danforth to conduct the
simulation determined that the flashes were caused by reflections
from water and metal, not gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell had initially sought the test, but he later argued that
the simulation was imprecise. He said overlooking the flaws, such
as the poor quality of the simulation tape and what he termed
mistakes by the British company in carrying out the simulation,
``is both irresponsible and a disservice to the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Friday's news conference, Danforth emphasized that
the scope of his probe was limited to ``whether government agents
engaged in bad acts, not whether they exercised bad judgment.'' He
said his parameters were confined to certain specific questions:
Did federal agents start the fire? Did they shoot at the Davidians
on April 19? Did they use pyrotechnic devices? Was there any
illegal use of the military? Was there a cover-up?
</P>
<P>
   An ordained Episcopal minister, Danforth was chosen, in part,
because of his reputation in the Senate for integrity and
rectitude. In conducting his inquiry, he had 16 lawyers and 38
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The Branch Davidian episode began on Feb. 28, 1993, when a
gunfight broke out as Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents
attempted to serve a warrant on Koresh at the compound near Waco.
Four ATF agents were killed. The ensuing 51-day standoff ended on
April 19 when FBI agents sought to subdue the Branch Davidians by
firing tear gas into the compound with tanks. The wooden structure
erupted in flames and burned to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Government critics have claimed that federal agents, frustrated
and angry, were either partly, or completely, responsible for the
deaths of those inside.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the investigation will address the actions of
those who hid information about the use of pyrotechnic rounds,
which have disappeared from evidence collected at the scene. In the
report, Danforth criticizes government lawyers for making
misleading statements about the rounds during the discovery process
of the civil wrongful death lawsuit. He also criticized the FBI's
failure, until September 1999 to release an audiotape of Richard
Rogers, the head of the FBI Hostage Rescue Team, authorizing the
use of the explosive rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said Reno and then-FBI Director William Sessions had
sought and received reassurances from field agents that pyrotechnic
rounds had not been used on April 19. Both testified to this before
Congress in 1993. The report stated that Rogers sat behind them
silently and his failure to correct their statements was `a
significant omission that contributed to the public perception of a
cover-up, which permitted a false impression to persist for several
years.`
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said he was not paying attention to their comments during
the testimony. Danforth said the remainder of his investigation
would address questions surrounding why government lawyers and FBI
officials hid the existence of the pyrotechnic rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's office will not pursue any further investigation of
Rogers or any other members of the hostage rescue team, the report
said.
