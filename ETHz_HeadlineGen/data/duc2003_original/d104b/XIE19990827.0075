WASHINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno pledged Thursday to investigate the truth of Waco incident in
which over 80 members of the Branch Davidian cult were killed as
their compound in Waco, Texas, was set on fire on April 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
Reno's pledge came after the Federal Bureau of Investigations
(FBI) admitted that its agents may have fired potentially
flammable tear gas canisters on the final day of their standoff
with the the cult six years after the incident.
</P>
<P>
The FBI denied categorically that flammable devices were used
in their standoff with the Branch Davidian cult led by David
Koresh.
</P>
<P>
"I have no reason at this point to believe the FBI is
responsible for the deaths of those people," Reno told her weekly
news conference at the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
She said she was "very, very frustrated" that six years after
categorical denials by the FBI there were news reports about the
possible use of flammable devices.
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely critical that we do everything humanly
possible to learn all the facts as accurately as possible and make
them available to the Congress and public," said Reno.
</P>
<P>
"I will continue to pursue this matter to get to the truth,"
she said. "I intend the results of the review to be made public
and I will not stop until I get to the bottom of this."
</P>
<P>
Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh have ordered a fresh
investigation of what transpired on April 19, 1993, at the Branch
Davidian compound.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Reno and Freeh ordered 40 FBI agents to re-interview
everyone who was at the Waco scene on that day.
</P>
<P>
FBI spokesman John Collingwood said Wednesday night that the
agents are to report "within weeks" on all aspects of the use of
military-type tear gas and why it took so long to be admitted
publicly.
