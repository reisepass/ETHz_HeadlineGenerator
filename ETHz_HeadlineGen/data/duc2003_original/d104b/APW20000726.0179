   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An FBI lawyer ''goofed'' in not telling
superiors in 1996 that federal agents fired pyrotechnic tear gas
canisters into the Branch Davidians' compound in Waco, Texas, a
former senator who investigated the deadly raid said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That simple mistake by a ''very junior'' lawyer helped lead to
the controversy over whether the government was trying to hide the
fact the three canisters were fired, Special Counsel John Danforth
told a Senate Judiciary subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said the lawyer had marked on her ''to-do'' list in
1996 to tell the Justice Department about the canisters but never
did. Refusing to name the lawyer, he said she even lied about it
when his investigators questioned her but that there was no
maliciousness in her actions.
</P>
<P>
   ''What happened in this case was that this fairly young lawyer
simply goofed, simply failed to do an adequate job ... and in the
face of the fear of personal ruin ... she then began to concoct
various stories,'' Danforth said.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, a longtime Republican senator from Missouri, was
appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate the siege
after the government acknowledged, following years of denials, that
it used pyrotechnic tear gas canisters during the final assault.
</P>
<P>
   The siege began Feb. 28, 1993, when agents of the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms tried to arrest Branch Davidian
leader David Koresh. A gunfight broke out, leaving four ATF agents
and six Davidians dead, and the standoff started.
</P>
<P>
   It ended 51 days later on April 19, 1993, when tanks driven by
FBI agents pumped tear gas into the compound. A fire broke out and
80 Davidians, including Koresh, died, some from the fire, some from
gunshots.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth concluded last week with ''100 percent certainty'' that
federal agents did not start the fire or shoot at cult members. The
government also did not improperly use the military and did not
engage in a major cover-up, Danforth said.
</P>
<P>
   He continues to investigate why no one told the Justice
Department that the tear gas canisters were fired.
</P>
<P>
   Those canister had nothing to do with the fire, he told the
Senate Judiciary subcommittee on administrative oversight and the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   He said the FBI lawyer found out about the tear gas while
working on the Waco civil trial. On July 14, a five-member jury
decided that the government was not responsible for the fire.
</P>
<P>
   She marked it down on a list to tell her superiors but never
did, Danforth said. After that mistake, she was afraid to come
forward with the information, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think for a minute that this FBI lawyer was part of
any cover-up or conspiracy,'' Danforth said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Penn., asked Danforth whether he would
recommend prosecuting the lawyer for lying. Danforth said that
would be like hitting ''a gnat with a sledgehammer.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the government needs to find a way to reduce its
internal ''culture of fear'' and force its lawyers to be more open
and candid, he said.
