	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sifting through thousands of pages of  
documents provided four years ago to a congressional panel 
investigating the 1993 Waco tragedy, a House Democrat has turned up 
evidence that the Justice Department did notify Congress about the 
FBI's use of potentially incendiary tear gas. 
</P>
<P>
	That evidence, Rep. Henry Waxman charged Monday, was overlooked  
by Rep. Dan Burton, the House Republican who is leading a new 
inquiry into the government's deadly standoff with the Branch 
Davidians -- and who has accused Attorney General Janet Reno and the 
Justice Department of possibly concealing the truth from Congress 
and the public. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no indication that Chairman Burton or his staff  
thought to review these documents before accusing the attorney 
general of a cover-up,'' Waxman, D-Calif., wrote in a letter to the 
special counsel investigating the recently revived Waco 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Contrary to the allegations of cover-up, substantial evidence  
of the use of military tear gas rounds was, in fact, provided to 
Congress in 1995,'' said Waxman, who is top Democrat on the House 
Government Reform Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton, who chairs the committee, said the Justice Department  
buried the panel in an avalanche of documents shortly before the 
1995 hearings began, and congressional investigators depended on a 
Justice summary to guide them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Justice Department dumped 100,000 documents on the  
committee three days before the hearings, knowing that they 
couldn't possibly go through them,'' the Indiana Republican said in 
an interview. Although Burton was on the Government Reform 
Committee in 1995, he was not on the subcommittee that led the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton also noted that the Justice Department was forced to  
acknowledge last week that it failed in 1995 to give Congress the 
key page from a 1993 FBI lab report mentioning the use of military 
tear gas. The final page of that 49-page report, with the key tear 
gas mention, was missing, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that's a coincidence,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Almost six out of 10 Americans believe the FBI has been  
intentionally trying to cover up its actions at Waco, an ABC News 
poll released Monday indicated. Only one out of five polled said 
they thought Reno should resign, based on what they now know. The 
poll of 1,008 adults was taken Sept. 8-12 and has an error margin 
of plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	The records Waxman cited, discovered among more than 40 boxes of  
material compiled during the earlier House hearings, include an FBI 
pilot's 1993 statement recalling a radio transmission in which 
agents had a conversation ``relative to the utilization of some 
sort of military round ... on a concrete bunker.'' And post-raid 
interview summaries include an unnamed FBI agent's explanation that 
smoke captured on film ``came from (an) attempt to penetrate bunker 
with one military and two (non-incendiary) rounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Houston lawyer who is representing surviving Davidians in  
their upcoming wrongful-death lawsuit against the government, said 
the records offer little proof of candor by Justice and FBI 
officials in their earlier appearances on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	``The point is not whether anybody ever discussed the use of  
military rounds. The point is that representations were made that 
no pyrotechnic devices were used ... and unless you were a 
munitions expert, you would not know that military CS gas was 
necessarily a pyrotechnic device,'' said lawyer Michael Caddell. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the FBI's recent admission that a ``very limited number''  
of pyrotechnic rounds were fired, Justice and FBI officials had 
publicly denied the use of potentially incendiary tear gas. That 
about-face sparked congressional outrage and led Reno to appoint an 
outside investigator, former Sen. John Danforth. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth, a Missouri Republican with solid credentials on  
Capitol Hill, said determining whether the government's actions 
triggered the inferno that ended the 51-day siege will be among the 
``dark questions'' his investigation will cover. 
</P>
<P>
	Cult leader David Koresh and some 80 followers died during the  
blaze, some from the fire, others from gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI and Reno maintain that Davidians deliberately set the  
fire. They have said the pyrotechnic canisters bounced off the roof 
of a concrete bunker and rolled harmlessly into a field hours 
before the blaze began.
