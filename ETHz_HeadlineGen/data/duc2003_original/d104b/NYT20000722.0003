<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Answering the ``dark questions'' that have lingered
for seven years, John Danforth said Friday that blame for the
bloodshed in Waco rests entirely with Branch Davidians, not
government agents.
</P>
<P>
   A 10-month probe led by the former Missouri senator also found
no evidence of a government coverup or improper military
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's 149-page interim report exonerates Attorney General
Janet Reno and, he hopes, puts to rest conspiracy theories about
Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any open-minded person, any fair-minded person, who
reads this will say, `This is the way it was,' '' Danforth told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   David Koresh and about 80 Davidians died in an inferno following
raids of their compound near Waco, Texas, on April 19, 1993. The
raids, and allegations of a coverup, caused some lawmakers to
demand Reno's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Reno appointed Danforth special counsel to
investigate Waco after revelations that the FBI used tear-gas
rockets that could have sparked a fire, a contradiction of earlier
government claims.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's report concluded that government agents did not set
the fire at Waco or shoot at the Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   But the government did not get off entirely. In an interview
with The Kansas City Star, Danforth said the lack of candor about
the pyrotechnic devices contributed to public suspicion about Waco.
</P>
<P>
   He said that deception allowed the media, politicians and
extremists to fuel conspiracy theories and erode public confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result is that people who want to believe the worst in
government say, `Aha! This is something that is really bad so
everything is suspicious.' The lesson is that government has to be
open,'' Danforth said.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to Danforth's report indicated that skepticism remains
strong.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Klayman, chairman and general counsel of the conservative
legal group Judicial Watch, said he wasn't surprised. He said his
group, which is suing the Justice Department to get access to
documents involving the Waco standoff, will continue its
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Janet Reno knew what she was getting when she appointed
Danforth,'' Klayman said. ``Danforth is establishment and we expect
him to scratch the back of the establishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Klayman said Danforth's sweeping exoneration of the agents on
the scene would breed further mistrust of government. To exonerate
the government for actions that left about 80 dead insults the
American people, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth would not comment on whether the government exercised
bad judgment at Waco because his research only addressed ``bad
acts.'' He said he did not want to emulate special counsels whose
investigations ``morphed'' into wide ranging topics.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth expects to present a final report by the fall. He said
his investigation of the 51-day siege is about 95 percent complete.
</P>
<P>
   The report addresses four major questions: Did federal law
officers shoot into the compound? Did agents start the fire? How
involved was the military? Was there a government coverup?
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found no evidence that FBI agents returned fire
from the Davidians. The report stated flashes that occurred around
government vehicles were reflections or ``glint'' from scattered
debris.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews, autopsies, ballistics tests and other evidence
indicates that Davidians who died from gunshot wounds committed
suicide or were killed by other Davidians, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also placed blame for the deadly fire on the
Davidians. The report describes conversations among Davidians
picked up by government listening devices within the compound.
Several discussions involved ways to pour fuel and start a fire.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators did find evidence that an FBI agent fired three
pyrotechnic tear-gas rounds. But the report states that the rounds
were fired at an outbuilding that was under construction 75 feet
from the Davidian complex.
</P>
<P>
   They could not have ignited the fire because the bounced off the
building and they were launched about four hours before the fire
erupted, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's report was the second time in a week that the
government was cleared of wrong-doing at the Davidians' Mt. Carmel
complex.
</P>
<P>
   A five-member jury in Waco decided July 14 that federal agents
were not responsible for the Davidians' deaths. The jury's ruling
was only advisory, but both sides expect a U.S. District judge to
hold the government blameless when he issues a final ruling.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis Freeh was heartened by the findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simple truth, as the FBI has maintained since April 19,
1993, has been unmistakingly confirmed again today _ the FBI fired
no shots on that day and the Davidians started the fire that
ultimately engulfed the compound,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the military's involvement, the report found that armed
forces ``conducted themselves properly and commendably,'' by
providing reconnaissance, training and medical assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The report also found no evidence that Reno intentionally
covered up the use of the three pyrotechnic rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any misstatement that (Reno) made was inadvertent and occurred
after diligent efforts on her part to learn the truth,'' the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Danforth harshly criticized several Justice Department
lawyers and FBI agents for concealing the use of pyrotechnic
devices, even though the rounds caused no harm.
</P>
<P>
   He said repeated denials by the FBI and the Justice Department
from 1993 until last year seriously undermined the government's
credibility. The report noted that the last page of a key FBI lab
report was omitted from the information turned over to
congressional investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The missing page showed that the FBI had used pyrotechnic tear
gas canisters, which can spark a fire under certain conditions.
Reno, in granting the order to storm the Davidians' compound, had
ordered the FBI not to use such propellants because of the risk of
fire.
</P>
<P>
   An internal Justice Department report was at best misleading
when it said tear gas delivery systems were ``completely
nonincendiary,'' the report said. Testimony to Congress was
similarly suspect, it said.
</P>
<P>
   And during preparation for a criminal trial against surviving
Davidians, prosecutors falsely told defense attorneys that they had
no evidence that government agents used pyrotechnic rounds. They
made the statement despite agents' reports that such rockets were
used, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth wrote that those actions were reprehensible because
they undermined public confidence. Lawyers in private practice
might skirt the truth, but that is not acceptable for the
government, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government lawyers have responsibilities beyond winning the
cases at hand...,'' he wrote. ``Government lawyers carry on their
shoulders responsibility for not only the prosecution of specific
cases, but also for public confidence in our system of
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, who has the power of prosecution, said he does not
expect to charge the officials.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Caddell, a Houston attorney who represents most of the
families of people who died, said several of Danforth's conclusions
echoed his own. But he said he was bothered that Danforth decided
not to pursue criminal charges against those who lied.
</P>
<P>
   ``That cannot help but add to the impression that a double
standard exists for government misconduct,'' Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, an ordained Episcopal priest, said he saw his Waco
investigation as part of a higher crusade to restore public
confidence in government. He called it ``the most important work
I've ever done.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said his conclusions are unanimously shared by the
team's 16 attorneys and 38 investigators. Danforth's team, based in
St. Louis, sifted through more than 2 million pages of documents
and interviewed almost 900 witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt, whatsoever, in my mind as to these
conclusions. This is not a close call,'' Danforth said. ``These
`dark questions' have been answered with total certainty.'' (MORE)
