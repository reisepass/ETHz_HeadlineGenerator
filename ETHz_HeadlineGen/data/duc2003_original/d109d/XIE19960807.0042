TOKYO, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Japanese government officials
finally responded today to the appeals of medical experts to
declare the two-month-old food poisoning outbreak an infectious
disease.
</P>
<P>
But the more than 9,200 patients who have come down with the
E. coli O-157 bacteria will not be immediately rounded up into
isolation wards, Health and Welfare Minister Naoto Kan told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in 20 years for the ministry to declare an
epidemic as infectious under the country's 1897 Communicable
Disease Prevention Law, which allows authorities to isolate
patients and even set up traffic blockades if necessary.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has decided that the law will be partially invoked
and patients, including 6,500 people in the western Japanese city
of Sakai, will not be moved to isolation wards.
</P>
<P>
The series of measures to be taken under the law include
regulations concerning food-handling work by patients and O-157
bacterium carriers as well as sales and use of contaminated food
and well water.
</P>
<P>
They also include mandated inspections into facilities
suspected of being contaminated with the virulent bacillus.
</P>
<P>
Doctors now have to report to authorities when treating E. coli
O-157 patients.
</P>
<P>
To prevent secondary infection, relatives of O-157 patients
will have to undergo medical checkups as well.
</P>
<P>
Japanese medical workers have been appealing to the government
to declare the food poisoning outbreak, which has so far killed
seven people, as an infectious disease.
