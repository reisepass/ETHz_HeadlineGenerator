LONDON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A 70-year-old man has become
the 11th victim in the food poisoning outbreak in Lanarkshire,
Scotland, and an expert has warned that the crisis could result in
up to 100 deaths.
</P>
<P>
BBC television said today that the Lanarkshire old man had been
in hospital suffering the food poisoning caused by the E coli
bacteria since November 30.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that E coli is a common gut bacteria that is
normally harmless, but a toxic strain that lives in cattle can be
passed to human via manure or improper slaughtering.
</P>
<P>
Two butcher's shops which were linked to the crisis have been
closed.
</P>
<P>
Professor Richard Lacey, a long-standing critic of the food
industry, said kidney failure could occur months after infection
with the E coli bacteria.
</P>
<P>
Lacey added that the factory which supplied the butcher at the
center of the crisis should be closed, and other outlets served by
the factory should also be shut down.
</P>
<P>
He also warned of the possible creation of a "super bug" in
which the E coli toxin combined with another bacterium.
