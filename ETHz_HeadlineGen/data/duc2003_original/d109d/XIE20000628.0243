OTTAWA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The E. coli toll in Canada may have
reached 21, with another three deaths reported Tuesday under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Health officials in the country's southern province of Ontario
are investigating the deaths of three women, all in their 80s, to
decide if they died of the killer E. coli disease.
</P>
<P>
Authorities have confirmed at least seven E. coli-linked deaths
since the disease hit Walkerton in Ontario last month.
</P>
<P>
Although local chief coroner Dr. James Young has said not all
the deaths are necessarily related to the E. coli outbreak,
continued reports of E. coli cases arouses fear that the rest of
the toll could also result from the disease.
</P>
<P>
In another development Tuesday, doctors at the George Dumont
Hospital in New Brunswick confirmed four cases of E. coli
contamination.
</P>
<P>
None of the victims, including a 12-year-old boy, died from the
infection. Local health officials have identified the bacteria
found in the contamination as the same E. coli O-157 that has
sickened up to 2,000 citizens in Walkerton, a small farm town of 5,
000.
</P>
<P>
New Brunswick is a third Canadian province to report E. coli
cases after more than 30 people were stricken by the disease last
week in Montreal, Quebec.
</P>
<P>
Canada has launched a nation-wide recall of the ground beef
from a Alberta-based meat packer after the same strain of bacteria
was discovered a few days ago in beef samples.
