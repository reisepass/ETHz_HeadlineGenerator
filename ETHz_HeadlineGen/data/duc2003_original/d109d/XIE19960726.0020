NEW YORK, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Outbreaks of food poisoning
caused by a fierce strain of E. coli bacteria like the one now
going on in Japan also have occurred in the United States, New
York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The bacterium is a familiar, and usually harmless, inhabitant
of the human and animal gut. It was first identified as a problem
in 1982 and was recognized as hazard by doctors only after four
people died and 700 became ill in 1993 in the northwestern United
States. The outbreak was caused by undercooked hamburgers.
</P>
<P>
Since 1982, doctors have found that the bacteria strain, known
as O157:7, has borrowed a new gene to make shiga toxin, which
causes shigella dysentery when carried by a different bug.
</P>
<P>
The borrowed shiga toxin, when combined with the native ability
of E.coli to proliferate in the intestine, can trigger the
signature symptoms of the new food-borne outbreaks: Watery
diarrhea followed by bloody diarrhea, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
The bacteria are most often passed from the fences of animals
to the surface of poorly butchered meat.
</P>
<P>
E. coli O157:H7 may cause 20,000 illnesses in the United States
each year, and 250-500 deaths, according to the Federal Center for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Additional 20,000 cases of food poisoning in the United States
may be caused by shiga toxin in other strains of bacteria, the
Federal Centers noted. There are an estimated seven million cases
of food poisoning a year from all causes, accounting for several
thousand deaths.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Japan and the United States, The New York Times
said, Outbreaks of food poisoning caused by E. coli Bacteria also
occurred in recent years in Australia, Africa and Europe. So the
fierce microbe is a rising worldwide problem, the newspaper
warned.
