   CLEVELAND (AP) -- At least six children in northeast Ohio have
been infected by E. coli bacteria and the Medina County Fair is a
possible source of the contamination, the state health department
and Cleveland Clinic doctors said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio Department of Health said six cases of E. coli O157:H7
have been confirmed, with two in Cuyahoga County and one each
Medina, Lorain, Wayne and Lake counties.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at the Cleveland Clinic put the number of cases at seven
and said that overall 12 children have been treated in the area for
bloody diarrhea, a symptom of E. coli contamination.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to diarrhea, E. coli can cause severe abdominal
cramping and -- in the most serious cases -- kidney failure. The
bacteria kill an estimated 60 Americans each year and sicken an
estimated 73,000 more, mostly children or the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The four children admitted to the Cleveland Clinic had attended
the fair, which ran from July 31 to Aug. 6. The exact source of the
infection has not been pinpointed.
</P>
<P>
   No one answered the phone at the fair office Monday after
business hours.
</P>
<P>
   E. coli can be spread through contaminated food or drinking
water, contact with cattle manure or through person-to-person
contact.
