   Epidemiologists have re-created in laboratories the elusive bug
that they believe caused severe stomach illness in almost 60
students and instructors who attended a University of North Texas
drill team camp a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although that brings them closer to discovering the origin of
the outbreak, the investigation is far from over, officials said.
On Monday, technicians prepared to send samples for further testing
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a bacteria. We don't know his name,'' said David
Bergmire-Sweat, an epidemiologist at the Texas Department of Health
in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The bacteria has some of the characteristics of E. coli O157:H7,
which killed more than a dozen people on the West Coast six years
ago, but it doesn't appear to be the same one, Bergmire-Sweat said.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are that state technicians won't be able to isolate it
until they can grow enough of it to survive the trip to Atlanta, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   CDC officials said they suspect it is E. coli, a bacteria
commonly found in healthy humans and animals that when mutated can
cause diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, cramping and related symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our discussions of it, it is a very reasonable
possibility,'' said Paul Mead, a CDC epidemiologist.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, more stool and blood samples are being collected and
sent to labs at the Texas Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   State and Tarrant County health officials said they have
interviewed almost 150 students during the weekend _ both sick and
well _ to try and establish links.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the challenge is that gastrointestinal illnesses are
more common in summer months, said Bob Jones, an epidemiologist at
the Fort Worth Public Health Department, which is aiding the county
and state in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Officials must differentiate between routine cases and illnesses
associated with the outbreak, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make sure it's significant, as opposed to something
that just normally would be happening anyway,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have identified 58 students and instructors who became
ill after attending a drill team camp June 9-11 at the University
of North Texas in Denton.
</P>
<P>
   Their symptoms include diarrhea, cramping, nausea, vomiting,
dizziness and fever.
</P>
<P>
   One instructor and one student, a 16-year-old Colleyville
Heritage High School drill team member, were hospitalized with
kidney problems.
</P>
<P>
   The girl was in fair condition and on kidney dialysis Monday at
Baylor Medical Center in Dallas. No information was available on
the instructor, who was at Medical City Dallas, health officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials have not speculated on where the illness
originated. More than 700 students from 36 schools, including some
from Kansas and Oklahoma, attended the camp.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the university has hosted other camps for drill
teams and cheerleaders, and there have been no reports of
illnesses, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   E. coli has hundreds of strains that can live in the intestines
of healthy humans or animals. Most don't cause problems until a
mutated strain produces Shiga toxin, named for a Japanese scientist
who isolated the dysentery bacterium in the late 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   The toxins cause the severe stomach illness associated with E.
coli bacteria infection.
</P>
<P>
   E. coli, commonly associated with undercooked hamburger meat,
also can be transmitted through unpasteurized juices and unwashed
ground crops such as lettuce and cantaloupes. Food can also be
infected by handlers who do not wash their hands after using the
restroom.
</P>
<P>
   E. coli and shigella, a bacilli that also can cause dysentery,
can usually be treated with antibiotics, Jones said. Most of the
drill team members who became sick have recovered, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, health officials are receiving scattered reports of family
members who are reporting similar symptoms.
