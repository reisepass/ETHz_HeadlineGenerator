	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An E. coli outbreak that sickened at least 6  
people visiting a Maine ski resort has been traced to contaminated 
ground beef produced at a Minnesota meat processing plant, 
authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have genetic fingerprints that link E. coli 0157:H7 in  
samples of the meat from Rochester Meats to the patients in Maine 
who have become ill,'' said Beth Gaston, spokesman for the 
Agriculture Department's food safety and inspection office. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking into whether or not other states may be involved  
as well,'' said Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	Rochester Meats Inc., of Rochester, Minn., last week recalled  
170,780 pounds of product -- the equivalent of one day's production. 
The company supplies meat for restaurants and institutions across 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials said Monday they were unaware of any link  
between their product and illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``USDA has not confirmed that with us,'' said Rochester Meats  
spokeswoman Joanne Randen. 
</P>
<P>
	The recalled products include frozen ground beef patties, ground  
chuck patties, chopped beefsteak, beef patties, meat for chili, 
beef patty mix and pure beef bulk. 
</P>
<P>
	The meat was produced Dec. 1 and sold in 10-, 15- and 20-pound  
packages. They are marked with the Julian code 8335 and 
Establishment 8999 in the inspection mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Maine officials had a tally of seven E. coli illnesses but USDA  
did not have confirmation that the seventh was a genetic match to 
the Rochester Meats outbreak, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The people became ill while visiting the Sunday River Ski Resort  
in Bethel, Maine, said Dr. Kathleen Gensheimer, state 
epidemiologist for the Maine Department of Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
	The first illness was reported Feb. 11, and three people had to  
be hospitalized, Gensheimer said. The entire group, which included 
four children, has since recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	It is possible that other people became ill but treated  
themselves instead of seeking medical attention, Geinsheimer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You always have to assume that in any scenario. . . one is  
probably only receiving information on those who are seriously ill 
versus those who are mildly ill,'' Gensheimer said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 cases of E. coli 0157:H7  
infection in the United States each year. 
</P>
<P>
	When ingested by humans, the E. coli bacterium can cause serious  
illness and sometimes death, especially in children and the 
elderly. Symptoms include chills and bloody diarrhea. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident is the second meat outbreak in the country in  
recent months. Bil Mar Foods in Zeeland, Mich. recalled 15 million 
pounds of hot dogs and deli meats in December because of possible 
contamination with listeria. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen deaths and six miscarriages and stillbirths have been  
linked to the Bil Mar recall.
