	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Nearly 500 people have been sickened and one  
child died in the largest E. coli outbreak in state history -- and 
possibly one of the worst nationally -- health officials said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The outbreak of the deadly bacteria at the Washington County  
Fair, about 35 miles north of Albany, was likely caused by the 
contamination of the fair's water. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials said the water supply may have been tainted  
when rainwater washed over cow feces from a nearby farm and ran 
into an underground aquifer tapped by the fair's wells. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, officials were worried that the contamination may  
have spread beyond the Greenwich fair. 
</P>
<P>
	A fair worker who sold sausages might have taken three gallons  
of tainted water with her to use for coffee, lemonade and frozen 
treats at the Rensselaer County Fair in Schaghticoke, state Health 
Commissioner Antonia Novello said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Novello said no cases of E. coli had been connected to the  
Rensselaer fair, one county to the south. 
</P>
<P>
	By Thursday, 497 people had been treated at hospitals for E.  
coli symptoms, Novello said. Eighty-five case have been confirmed 
as E. coli poisoning, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A child, 3-year old Rachel Aldrich of Clifton Park, succumbed to  
the Greenwich outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests showed that one of the wells at the Washington County Fair  
was infected with E. Coli bacteria. Health officials also think 
that a deadly strain of E. Coli, 0157:H7, also came from that well, 
but they have yet to find any traces of it. 
</P>
<P>
	The well is near a cattle barn and the ground around it had been  
dug up for the installation of two new wells. Heavy rains in late 
August could have driven E. coli contaminated cattle manure into 
the well, Novello said. 
</P>
<P>
	It is possible that health officials will never find the deadly  
strain since the first tests for E. coli were done Sept. 3, four 
days after the fair ended, said Donald Dixon Despommier, a 
microbiology professor at Columbia University's School of Public 
Health. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like closing the barn door after the horses are already  
gone,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests on the well in June showed no contamination, health  
officials said.
