 TAKAYAMA, JAPAN: without hindrance.

   But once in a great while a neutrino does hit an atom and the
resulting blast of nuclear debris supplies clues about the neutrino
itself. The debris generally includes many particles that can race
through water, mineral oil or even ice, sending shock waves of blue
light through the liquid or ice. This light, called Cherenkov
radiation, can be detected by sensitive light sensors and measured.

   During the past few decades, scientists have learned that matter
is made up of three distinct flavors or types. This means that
there are three flavors of neutrinos _ the electron neutrino
associated with the electron; the muon neutrinos associated with
the muon particle, which is a kind of fat electron, and the tau
neutrino, associated with the tau particle, an even fatter relative
of the electron.
</P>
<P>
   The role of the muon and tau particles along with their
associated neutrinos has mystified physicists ever since their
discoveries. ``Who ordered that?`` the Nobel-winning physicist
Isidor Rabi is said to have remarked when the muon was found.

   The Super-Kamiokande detector was built two years ago as a joint
Japanese-American experiment. It is essentially a water tank the
size of a large cathedral installed in a deep zinc mine one mile
inside a mountain 30 miles north of here. When neutrinos slice
through the tank, one of them occasionally makes its presence known
by colliding with an atom, which sends blue light through the water
to an array of detectors.
</P>
<P>
   The enormous volume of water in the detector increased the
likelihood of neutrino impacts to the point at which the discovery
of neutrino mass became possible.

   The Super-Kamiokande collaboration is studying several neutrino
phenomenon simultaneously, but the one that led to Friday's
announcement was based on ``atmospheric'' neutrinos created when
highly energetic cosmic ray particles from deep space slam into the
Earth's upper atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists knew that different flavors of neutrino constantly
arrive from the upper atmosphere, and they have calculated on the
basis of well-established theory that the ratio between muon
nutrinos and other flavors must have a certain value. But over the
years detectors found only about half the muon neutrinos predicted
by theory.
</P>
<P>
   However, Super-Kamiokande not only has enormous sensitivity but
it can sort out neutrino tracks according to their energies and the
directions from which they came.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent shortage of muon neutrinos was explained by the
recent observations that led to Friday's announcement. The
physicists found that when neutrinos coming from the sky directly
over the Super Kamiokande detector _ a relatively short distance _
the proportion of muon neutrinos among them was higher than among
the neutrinos coming up from beneath the detector after having
passed through the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists reasoned that by traveling through the entire
Earth these neutrinos had had time to ``oscillate,'' probably many
times, between muon neutrinos and some other type, especially the
tau neutrino, and this accounts for the deficit seen in muon
neutrinos. (The tau neutrino has not yet been directly detected but
it must exist to make observations consistent.)
</P>
<P>
   A related but different problem has to do with neutrinos
produced by the fusion process in the sun. This multi-step process,
which merges the nuclei of hydrogen atoms to form helium nuclei and
energy, produces neutrinos. Astrophysicists believe they understand
the mechanism in complete detail.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that all the best detectors ever built find far
fewer neutrinos than should be present according to understanding
of the fusion reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the Super-Kamiokande collaboration (and most other
physicists) believe the anomoly can be explained by the oscillation
of detectable solar nutrinos into types that cannot be detected by
existing instruments. But so far no one has proven this
explanation.
