	   TOKYO (AP) _ A mystery which has long puzzled the world's top
scientists appears to have finally been solved by a team of physics
experts working in a mine shaft in central Japan.
	   But the finding, announced Friday, still needs to be re-tested
before quieting skeptics.
	   An international team of 120 researchers said they have found
evidence that elusive, subatomic particles known as neutrinos _ one
of the basic building blocs of atoms _ have mass, or weight.
	   The finding was presented Friday at a physics conference in the
central Japanese city of Takayama by a group known as the
Super-Kamiokande Experiment research team composed of experts from
Japan, the United States, Germany and Poland.
	   What has many scientists around the world so excited about the
announcement is that, if true, it would force the rethinking of a
widely-accepted theory which states neutrinos are devoid of weight.
	   And it would answer a nagging question as to why the universe is
actually so much heavier than most models suggest it should be.
	   It also raises the intriguing possibility that the universe may
not keep expanding forever in the wake of the so-called Big Bang,
which started it all.
	   But not everyone is convinced.
	   Arthur McDonald, a professor of physics at Queen's University in
Kingston, Ontario, who heads another team conducting similar
research, cautioned it will take time to verify the results.
	   Paul Langacker, chairman of the department of physics and
astronomy at the University of Pennsylvania, said the finding is
the most exciting he has heard about in his 20-year career.
	   ``It is a very significant step forward,'' Langacker said.
	   But he added, ``If there were any weaknesses, it could be that
there were effects associated with the earth's magnetic field that
could cause distortions in the cosmic rays and mimic an effect like
this.''
	   To guard against such distortions, the Kamiokande team worked in
an abandoned mine shaft, burying their equipment in a kilometer
(half-mile) of rock to block cosmic rays and radiation.
	   Neutrinos are difficult to track because they have no electrical
charge and are so small that they pass right through matter.
	   The group used a 50,000-ton tank filled with purified water to
catch a glimpse of sparks created when neutrinos, part of the
trillions of particles that pass through the earth every second,
collide with atoms.
	   Though the scientists have not measured neutrino mass, they say
they detected that some neutrinos oscillate, or change type, as
they pass through space or matter. A key scientific theory says
anything that oscillates must have mass.
	   Yet physics' ``standard model'' theory of how fundamental
particles work decrees that neutrinos should weigh nothing at all.
It is this theory which may need to be revised because of the new
finding.
	   Neutrino mass could help explain why astronomers can't find 90
percent of the matter that's supposed to exist in the universe.
	   Given the speed at which the universe is expanding, physicists
think the universe should be of a certain mass. But when they add
up the weight of the planets, stars and all other known stuff in
the cosmos they get a number only 10 percent as large as their
theory predicts.
	   That inconsistency has lead many to conclude either that much
more of the universe is hidden in mysterious dark spots or that the
theory is seriously flawed.
	   The mass of an individual neutrino is perhaps billions of times
less than an electron, the particle with the smallest known mass.
But together all the neutrinos could account for a big part the
universe's mysteriously missing mass.
	   If the universe has enough mass, it must contract at some point
because of the pull of its own gravity.
