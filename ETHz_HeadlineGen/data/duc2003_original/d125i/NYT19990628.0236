   A team of Japanese, American and Korean scientists announced
Monday that they had for the first time fired a neutrino particle
through a 155-mile slice of the earth's crust and recorded its
arrival at the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The achievement marked the opening of an experiment expected to
last several years seeking evidence that neutrino particles in
flight oscillate from one form to another. Three types of neutrinos
are known to exist: muon neutrinos, electron neutrinos and tau
neutrinos.
</P>
<P>
   One year ago, Japanese and American scientists announced the
discovery of very strong evidence for oscillation between neutrino
types, or ``flavors,'' but the experiment begun this month could
independently buttress the case for oscillation even more strongly.
</P>
<P>
   Neutrinos, which have no electric charge, were long thought to
have no mass. But if, as now believed, they oscillate from one
flavor to another, the rules of quantum mechanics dictate that they
must have at least a little mass.
</P>
<P>
   Since neutrinos are ubiquitous throughout the universe, their
collective mass could have important consequences for cosmological
processes like the formation of galactic clusters.
</P>
<P>
   The latest experiment was done in Japan by KEK (a Japanese
acronym for High Energy Research Organization) near Tokyo and the
Super Kamiokande neutrino detector 155 miles to the west.
</P>
<P>
   On June 19 at 6:42 p.m., Japanese time, a big proton accelerator
at KEK fired a blast of muon neutrinos at a grazing angle into the
ground along a straight line leading to both a nearby neutrino
detector and the Super Kamiokande detector 155 miles away. Of the
trillions of neutrinos in the volley, the detector at the end of
the line recorded just one, a result consistent with a prediction
that about one artificially created neutrino would leave its trace
in the water filling the Kamiokande detector each day.
</P>
<P>
   The object of the experiment (called ``K2K,'' for ``KEK to
Kamiokande'') is fairly simple: to compare the flow of
accelerator-launched neutrinos hitting the near detector with that
of the neutrinos covering the 155 miles through the earth to Super
Kamiokande.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their ghostly nature, most neutrinos easily pass
unhindered through the entire earth, and only in the rarest case
does a neutrino hit something and leave its mark. The flux of
neutrinos reaching the near and far detectors should therefore be
about the same, unless neutrinos oscillate.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Super Kamiokande detector can register only muon
neutrinos, if many muon neutrinos from the accelerator change
flavor as they travel 155 miles, their new forms would not be
detected, and Super Kamiokande should see a net deficit, compared
with the muon neutrinos seen by the near detector.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the experiment has been running for only several
weeks, far too short a time to collect convincing data, several
scientists, who requested anonymity, said there was already a hint
of oscillation in the numbers. They said the evidence was mounting
that the oscillation was probably transforming muon neutrinos into
taus, which cannot be detected directly by the Kamiokande detector.
</P>
<P>
   There is also evidence, they said, that the participation of a
hypothetical sterile neutrino in oscillations can almost be ruled
out.
