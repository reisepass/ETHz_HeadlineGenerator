<P>
   Dr. Frederick Reines, whose fine baritone might have landed him
in opera instead of the career in neutrino physics that culminated
in the 1995 Nobel Prize, died Aug. 26 at the University of
California-Irvine Medical Center in Orange, Calif. He was 80 and
lived at the university campus, where he was distinguished
professor emeritus in physics.
</P>
<P>
   The university said he died after a long illness.
</P>
<P>
   Described by other scientists as the father of neutrino physics,
Reines (pronounced RYE-ness) had a reputation as an intense
researcher, often ahead of others in anticipating important physics
problems and always relentless in solving them.
</P>
<P>
   This was how Reines and a colleague made the discovery that
eventually earned him the Nobel accolade.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1930s, physicists predicted the existence of
neutrinos, virtually massless subatomic particles that move through
space and matter with so few interactions that their existence was
thought to be beyond detection. The theorists who predicted that
such ghostlike particles probably originate in nuclear reactions in
the Sun and in exploding stars despaired of ever discovering their
traces.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, while at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in New
Mexico, Reines decided to try the seemingly impossible: detect a
neutrino. It was typical of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always doing courageous things, expanding the limits of
research,'' said Dr. Jonas Schultz, another physicist at the Irvine
campus. ``He thought of ways to detect neutrinos, showed that it
could be done and that was a psychologically important breakthrough
in the whole field.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with Dr. Clyde Cowan, a Los Alamos colleague, Reines
used a nuclear reactor to produce neutrinos and a tank of water as
the agent of detection. The impacts of neutrinos coming from the
reactor produced flashes of light in the water tanks, which the two
scientists recorded and reported in 1956. Scientists were surprised
that it took the Nobel Prize committee until 1995 to recognize the
discovery.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Dr. Myron Bander of Irvine said the neutrino
discovery was ``a keystone to our understanding of elementary
particle physics.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only last June that other scientists, using detectors in
Japan, finally determined that the neutrino does have some mass and
thus could contribute to the so-called dark matter that pervades
and shapes the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Reines was born on March 16, 1918, in Paterson, N.J.,
to parents who were immigrants from Russia. As a boy in upstate New
York and later in North Bergen, N.J., he enjoyed building things,
earning merit badges to become an Eagle Scout and singing and
acting.
</P>
<P>
   Even in college, at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken,
N.J., he took singing lessons from a voice coach at the
Metropolitan Opera and had solo roles in Handel's ``Messiah.''
</P>
<P>
   But science won out, Reines said many years later, perhaps
because of an idle moment one afternoon in school. He was looking
out of the window at twilight through a hand curled to simulate a
telescope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I noticed something peculiar about the light,'' he recalled.
``It was the phenomenon of diffraction. That began for me a
fascination with light.''
</P>
<P>
   So he studied physics at Stevens and earned a doctorate at New
York University. Early in his career, he was part of the Los Alamos
team working on the atomic and hydrogen bombs. His first job was on
the theoretical staff headed by Dr. Richard Feynman, another future
Nobel laureate. Much of his research centered on the findings of
bomb tests on Enewetak and Bikini atolls in the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1959, he headed the physics department at Case
Institute of Technology (now Case Western University) in Cleveland
for seven years. He said the ``peak of my musical endeavors''
occurred at this time, when he sang with the chorus of the
Cleveland Symphony Orchestra. Otherwise he confined his music to
some Gilbert and Sullivan performances and singing at parties.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues also recalled that Reines sometimes locked himself in
his office to work on particularly difficult physics problems. He
could be heard singing opera for hours.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, Reines became the founding dean of physical sciences at
the new University of California campus at Irvine. He later
returned to full-time teaching and research, heading a team of
neutrino scientists. The team's subsequent research on neutrinos
from supernova 1987A won the Bruno Rossi prize in high-energy
physics from the American Astronomical Society.
</P>
<P>
   Reines married the former Sylvia Samuels in 1940, while he was
in college. She survives, as well as their two children, Robert G.,
of Ojo Sarco, N.M., and Alisa K. Cowden of Trumansburg, N.Y., and
six grandchildren.
