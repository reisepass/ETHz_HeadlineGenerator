   HIDA VILLAGE, Japan _ Everywhere in this restored 17th-century
village, old wayside shrines remind visitors of the belief that
Buddha could assume several manifestations, each representing one
of the deep tenets of Buddhist teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Barely a mile away from the old wood houses of this village is
the modern provincial town of Takayama, where trailblazing physics
is coming to light at an international conference on neutrino
particles.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the contrast between the carefully tended icons of Hida
(which bespeak ancient religious mysticism) and the research that
has been unveiled nearby during the past week, many Asian
scientists view the two worlds as complimentary rather than
conflicting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say that Buddhist tradition makes it easier for us to grasp
the dualities and transformations of particle physics,'' said one
of the Japanese scientists here, who spoke on condition he not be
identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, the duality of particles and waves manifested in
all the ingredients of matter has long been known, but although
everyone accepts this duality intellectually, the idea may be hard
to feel in your heart, unless you are Asian,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement last Friday that a coalition of Japanese and
American scientists had found strong evidence that neutrinos
undergo transformation from one type to another (and therefore have
mass) also evokes comparisons with Buddhist traditions of dualism.
</P>
<P>
   Neutrino particles have been called ``ghostly'' because of their
extraordinary ability to evade entrapment by the electromagnetic
and ``strong'' nuclear forces, which affect most other particles.
By contrast, a neutrino can easily zip through the entire earth
without hindrance, although once in a great while a neutrino may
bang into an electron orbiting an atom and send the electron
careening away (where a man-made detector may spot it).
</P>
<P>
   It has been known for a decade that neutrinos come in three
families. Physicist generally believed that each type had no mass,
did not transform itself into something else, had a property called
``spin'' of one-half, and that its spin was left-handed, relative
to the neutrino's direction of motion.
</P>
<P>
   But that description has been radically changed in the past
week. Now it seems, neutrinos have mass, and because of that, they
can also have right-handed spin, said Dr. Maurice Goldhaber, former
director of the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, who
is attending the meeting in Takayama.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s Goldhaber discovered the left-handed spin of
neutrinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neutrinos,'' he once wrote, ``induce courage in theoreticians
and perseverance in experimenters.''
</P>
<P>
   Muon neutrinos _ neutrinos associated with short-lived, highly
penetrating muon particles _ are now known beyond reasonable doubt
to ``oscillate'' over distance into one of the two other known
types, or perhaps even into a fourth, hypothetical, type called a
``sterile neutrino.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the conclusion of the 120 Japanese and American
physicists who have been looking for neutrino oscillations during
the past two years using a cathedral-size underground water tank
called Super-Kamiokande about 30 miles north of here.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is relatively easy to express the idea of neutrino
oscillation in words or equations, it is less easy to grasp the
counterintuitive wonder of the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stanley Wojcicki of Stanford University in California, one
of the neutrino scientists attending the conference here, compared
the discovery of neutrino oscillation to what light would undergo
if it could also oscillate.
</P>
<P>
   ``A beam of light in any color can be thought of as composed of
the three primary colors: Red, Green and Blue,'' Wojcicki wrote in
a recent summary. ``Imagine a beam that starts out as pure red
slowly acquiring a green or bluish tinge as it shines through
space.''
</P>
<P>
   By analogy, this is a kind of transformation that neutrinos are
known to undergo, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most recent neutrino experiments confirm the belief by many
physicists that neutrinos come in three _ and only three _
varieties. But controversy has arisen over an experiment performed
by the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Other laboratories have not
been able to confirm the Los Alamos result, but if the Los Alamos
work (and some related experiments by other groups) should prove
true, theorists would have to accept the need for ``new physics,''
specifically the existence of one or more sterile neutrinos.
</P>
<P>
   The hypothetical sterile neutrinos would be at the very edge
between existence and nonexistence, since they could be detected
only by the trace of gravitational pull they would exert.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Leon Lederman, retired director of the Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois, shared in the award of a Nobel
Prize for showing that there are more than one type of neutrino. He
once wrote that ``a particle that reacted with nothing whatever
could never be detected. It would be a fiction. The neutrino is
barely a fact.''
</P>
<P>
   This definition places the neutrino perilously close to
nonexistence, and a sterile neutrino that is affected only by
gravity becomes even more tenuous. Many physicists, who regard
``beautiful'' ideas in physics as more likely to be true than ugly
ones, regard sterile neutrinos as esthetically inelegant and
therefore improbable.
</P>
<P>
   Another peculiar hypothetical particle which has been sought for
four decades is the magnetic monopole _ an entity that has been
compared with the Zen Buddhist notion of the sound of one hand
clapping.
</P>
<P>
   A magnetic monopole, a supposed relic of the Big Bang explosion,
would have only a single magnetic polarity. An ordinary magnet,
whether it is a simple iron bar or the entire earth, always has
both a north and south pole. Cutting a magnet in two yields two
magnets, each with a north and south pole _ never a single pole.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, physicists have not ruled out the existence of
monopoles. Experiments at Fermilab in Illinois and within the Gran
Sasso mountain tunnel in Italy, among other laboratories, continue
to look for the elusive particle among the cosmic ray fragments
that hit the earth.
</P>
<P>
   If it is ever found, scientists from countries steeped in
Buddhist tradition will not be unduly overwhelmed.
