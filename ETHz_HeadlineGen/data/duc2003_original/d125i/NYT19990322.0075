   To me, the mystery in the latest neutrino news (Don't you, too,
subscribe to ``Neutrinos Today''?) is why the monstrous telescope
searching for these ephemeral subatomic particles is named after my
niece, who, in turn, is named after my grandmother, Amanda. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe the telescope isn't exactly named after Amanda but
certainly they share the same name _ although I don't think my
niece's name is an acronym for Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Detector
Array (which has its own Web site at http:/amanda.berkeley.edu). If
anything, my niece's name is an acronym for A Mighty Amazing Niece
Deserving Accolades. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But enough about her. If I carry on about her and her remarkable
luck of being able to living within walking distance of Wrigley
Field in Chicago, I'll never get around to why you should care
about the new search for the cosmic neutrino that AMANDA (I'll
capitalize the telescope to differentiate it from any of my
relatives) is working on. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it would help if I first explained what neutrinos are.
They're nothing. Well, almost nothing. It was long thought that
neutrinos had no mass, but last year some researchers announced
that, in fact, they do have a little mass. That startled the
scientific world, which still is trying to figure out what, if
anything, it means. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The universe is flooded with these itsy-bitsy things, whatever
they are. In fact, it's estimated that at any point in time about
100 million neutrinos are penetrating your body as they zip in from
outer space. Traveling at (or darn close to) the speed of light,
they also pass right through Earth, undetected. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's where AMANDA comes in. This novel astronomical telescope
has been assigned the duty of detecting cosmic neutrinos and their
source. How do you, in effect, hold a moonbeam in your hand? Well,
you begin with 422 glass orbs, each the size of a bowling ball.
Really. That's what AMANDA is mostly made of. They're called
photomultiplier tubes, and they're sunk several kilometers deep
into the ice at the South Pole. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All of which sort of makes you wonder how scientists dream up
this stuff. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hoofensticker: ``Say, Dr. Tiliwocken, I've got an idea.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tiliwocken: ``What's that?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dr. H: ``Let's string together 422 bowling ball-size glass
balls, bury them deep below the Antarctic ice and see if they'll
detect teeny-weeny things we can't possibly see.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dr. T: ``Why, I think you're onto something! Let's do it! I'll
send an application to the government for a grant right away.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The problem, of course, is that if you waited around for a
scientific idea that made complete intuitive sense, you'd never do
any experiments. Science is, at its core, an enterprise that
regularly tests unreasonable ideas because the entire cosmos, if
not unreasonable, is at least something the human mind would not
have dreamed up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you or I had created the world, for instance, would we have
arranged for billions of weightless, chargeless, invisible
particles to flood the cosmos? No way. We'd get accused of what
Bill Clinton swears he didn't do _ inhaling. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From what scientists can tell, this marauding army of neutrinos
is generated by such far out celestial entities as black holes,
supernovas, quasars, gamma ray bursts and neutron stars. And if
they can figure out where they came from they may get a better
handle on how the universe developed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As intriguing as this is, so far I understand almost none of
this AMANDA stuff. And my smart old Swedish grandmother, Amanda,
isn't around any more to help me. If my niece Amanda has a clue,
I'll get back to you. Or not. &QL;
