   What many physicists consider to be one of the last pieces of
the theoretical puzzle that explains the structure of matter has
been detected at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory near
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   A international team of scientists will announce Friday that
they have detected the tau neutrino, considered to be the most
elusive member of nature's most ghostly family of particles, the
neutrinos.
</P>
<P>
   The team of 54 physicists from institutions in the United
States, Japan, South Korea and Greece used the world's most
powerful particle accelerator, Fermilab's Tevatron, to fire an
estimated 100 trillion tau neutrinos into an advanced emulsion
similar to photographic film.
</P>
<P>
   Four of those neutrinos produced minute but clearly recognizable
streaks in the emulsion.
</P>
<P>
   Although their existence had been suspected for 25 years, tau
neutrinos had escaped detection because it takes a large amount of
energy to create them and because neutrinos pass through most
matter almost without a trace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been accepted that this guy exists,'' said Regina
Rameika, a physicist at Fermilab and a member of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Neutrinos are particles _ with no electrical charge and probably
little mass _ that rarely interact with other matter. They are
created by some of the most basic physical processes of the
universe, such as the decay of radioactive elements and fusion
reactions that power the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the tau neutrino remained one of two major undetected
particles in the vast theoretical structure called the standard
model of particle physics. The theory describes the properties of
all the known building blocks of matter, from quarks, protons,
neutrons and electrons to the neutrinos.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining unseen particle, called the Higgs boson, is
considered a linchpin of the entire structure. The new finding
clears the way for a race between Fermilab and a European
laboratory, CERN, to detect the Higgs.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Langacker, a physicist at the University of Pennsylvania
who was not part of the group, called the neutrino experiment
``very subtle and difficult'' and said that as recently as five
years ago, many physicists believed that such a detection of the
tau neutrino would be all but impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The remaining piece of the standard model itself is the Higgs
particle,'' Langacker said. ``There are strong indirect indications
that it is right around the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   The experiment is also a step toward clearing up some of the
remaining mysteries concerning neutrinos themselves.
</P>
<P>
   According to the standard model, neutrinos have no mass. But two
years ago, a Japanese experiment called Super-Kamiokande found
evidence that neutrinos do have at least a small mass, without
determining what that mass is.
</P>
<P>
   So the detection of the tau neutrino was a crucial prerequisite
for planned experiments at Fermilab and CERN to help determine the
mass of the neutrino.
</P>
<P>
   The experiments involve shooting beams of neutrinos hundreds of
miles underground to distant detectors to see if one type of
neutrino changes into another en route. According to advanced
theories, any such transmutation would be an indication of the
mass.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing the value of the mass could help settle several cosmic
mysteries, including how much swarms of neutrinos in space might
contribute to the weight of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be able to make tau neutrinos and detect them directly is
going to be very important in this whole new world of neutrino
physics,'' said Martin L. Perl, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist at
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.
</P>
<P>
   The physicist Wolfgang Pauli first postulated the existence of
neutrinos in the 1930s to account for energy and momentum that
seemed to vanish during the radioactive decay of various elements.
So weakly do the particles interact with matter that physicists had
to wait nearly 30 years for the first detection of any neutrinos.
</P>
<P>
   The first two types of neutrinos to be seen are closely
associated with electrons and muons, much less bizarre particles
that are grouped in a classification called leptons within the
standard model. Leptons are a class of particles that do not
interact strongly with matter.
</P>
<P>
   So when Perl and colleagues discovered a new lepton, called the
tau particle, in 1975, they assumed that the electron neutrino and
muon neutrino would soon have company.
</P>
<P>
   But making a tau neutrino requires first making a tau particle _
and because it is much more massive than the other leptons, that
requires an accelerator with much greater energies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neutrino experiments are very difficult to begin with,'' said
Roger Rusack, a physicist at the University of Minnesota who is a
member of the team, ``and we're looking at a neutrino that's very
hard to make.''
</P>
<P>
   The team did produce them in bulk by smashing protons
accelerated to nearly the speed of light at the Tevatron into
tungsten. Tau particles created in the maelstrom decayed into tau
neutrinos, which streamed through thick layers of shielding that
blocked most other particles and reached the emulsions.
</P>
<P>
   There, very rarely, a tau neutrino collided with an atomic
nucleus and produced other particles, including a tau particle,
that left a characteristic, kinked trail in the emulsion. The
crucial part of that trail was only about a millimeter long, and
the technique for finding such subtle features was developed at
Nagoya University in Japan, one of the partners in the experiment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It means that we've finally seen the interactions from the tau
neutrino, which was assumed to exist in 1975,'' said Byron
Lundberg, the Fermilab physicist who, with Vittorio Paolone of the
University of Pittsburgh, is a spokesman for the experiment.
</P>
<P>
   David O. Caldwell, a physicist at the University of California
in Santa Barbara, said that it would have been ``an incredible
surprise'' if the tau particle did not have its own neutrino, as
the electron and the muon do.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that some speculative theories beyond the standard
model postulate yet another neutrino _ a so-called sterile neutrino
that would be associated with no other particle _ and that it was
important to confirm the existence of tau neutrinos before
physicists ranged further afield.
</P>
<P>
   Particle physicists are likely to turn their immediate attention
to the search for the Higgs boson. The first experiments with a
chance of finding it are scheduled to begin next spring at
Fermilab's Tevatron. If the particle is not seen there, it could
turn up at a much more powerful accelerator called the Large Hadron
Collider, which should begin operation at CERN in 2005 or 2006.
