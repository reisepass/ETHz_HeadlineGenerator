   NEW YORK _ After following hundreds of homeless families in New
York City to determine if social disorders prolonged their
situation, a new study by New York University suggests the real
problem is the city's scarcity of subsidized housing.
</P>
<P>
   The study, to be released Tuesday in the American Journal of
Public Health, challenges a widely held view that the most
effective way to end homelessness among families is by first
resolving such problems as mental illness and substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The study concluded that homeless families, when provided with
subsidized housing, could remain ``stable'' _ which the study
defined as staying in the same apartment for at least 12 months _
regardless of the problems they battled. The research, done between
1988 and 1993, is considered the first long-term look at how social
disorders affect families' abilities to find their way out of
homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conventional wisdom is that homeless families need to
become rehabilitated before they can become housed,'' said Marybeth
Shinn, a professor of psychology at New York University and
co-author of the study. ``Our findings show that if given the
housing first, homeless families will become stable and remain
stable.''
</P>
<P>
   The study did not look at single homeless adults, where
incidents of mental illness and substance abuse tend to be more
serious and widespread.
</P>
<P>
   In reaching their conclusion, researchers interviewed 564
families. Half of them were homeless for the first time; the other
half were randomly drawn from the city's public assistance case
load and had never been homeless. Every family was interviewed
twice, once in 1988 and again five years later.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers found that 80 percent of the homeless families who
were given a subsidized apartment were able to remain stable,
despite their problems. Their rate of success in remaining housed
matched that of the families who had never been homeless. One
reason for the homeless families' success, researchers concluded,
was that their rent was paid directly to a landlord.
</P>
<P>
   The study did not address what effect the acquisition of a
stable apartment had on helping the families resolve their personal
problems.

   ``We're not saying that social services couldn't prove
advantageous to these families, or that substance abuse and mental
illness don't take tolls on families,'' said Beth Weitzman,
associate professor in NYU's Robert Wagner Graduate School of
Public Service and a co-author of the study. ``But those issues are
all separate and distinct from homelessness. Just because a family
has problems doesn't mean they can't remain housed.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the homeless families who did not receive subsidized housing,
only 18 percent found permanent housing, mostly by moving in with a
relative or friend, the study found. Researchers linked their low
success rate in part to the fact that some families left the
shelter before they were deemed eligible for housing. Those who
left forfeited their spots on the waiting list. During the time of
the study, most families had to wait six to 18 months before
becoming eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Some veteran researchers of homelessness hailed the NYU study
for trying to refocus one of the oldest debates surrounding
homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``This study will inevitably be read by many people as
dismissing the importance of social services,'' said Jim Baumohl,
an associate professor of social welfare at Bryn Mawr College in
Pennsylvania. ``But what it's really saying is that if the goal is
still to reduce shelter utilization, then we to ought to consider a
strategy of rapid attachment to housing, rather than assuming
homeless families can't stay housed.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Wiviott, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of
Homeless Services, said she had not yet seen a copy of the study.
But she said the city shared the view that subsidized housing was
an effective way of helping the 4,700 homeless families now living
in the city's shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Giuliani administration took office, Ms. Wiviott said,
21,000 homeless families have moved out of shelters and into
subsidized housing. But she added that in the wake of the federal
government's recent decision to scale back national housing
subsidies, New York was ill equipped to foot the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alone, we can't afford to house everybody who needs subsidized
housing. Our hope is that Washington recognizes the need to
continue its contribution of Section 8 and other federal
subsidies.''
</P>
<P>
   The NYU study was financed through a grant from the National
Institute of Mental Health.
