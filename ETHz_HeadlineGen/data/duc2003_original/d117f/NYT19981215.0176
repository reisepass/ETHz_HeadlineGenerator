   SAN FRANCISCO _ Nearly 160 homeless men and women died in San
Francisco in the past year, the most deaths recorded since the city
began tracking such statistics in 1987, the Department of Public
Health said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A study released by the department blamed the city's dearth of
homeless shelters and lack of substance abuse programs for
contributing to the 157 deaths recorded from Dec. 1, 1997, through
Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The report also attributed the high number of homeless deaths to
a lack of available and affordable housing, the year's
exceptionally wet weather and illness.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the homeless said they were not surprised by the
findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are dying because we're not dealing with the
problem,'' said Paul Boden, director of the Coalition on
Homelessness. ``That number is going to keep on growing until we
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Boden criticized the administration of Mayor Willie Brown for
spending city resources removing the homeless from parks and other
parts of the city rather than focusing on creating more substance
abuse programs and homeless shelters to help them.
</P>
<P>
   The 157 deaths far exceeded both the 104 recorded the previous
year and the average of 118 deaths each year since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   At least 86 deaths during the year were caused by substance
abuse problems. The city's rate of drug deaths is three times that
of the state, the report said. It noted that 62 of those deaths
were heroin-related, while pointing out that more than 500 people
are on waiting lists citywide for methadone treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Low vacancy rates, exorbitant rents and loss of public housing
units have exacerbated the homeless problem,'' the report said.
``At the same time, without permanent affordable housing, it is
exceedingly difficult for homeless people to manage their health
issues, such as diabetes, mental health or addiction.''
</P>
<P>
   The average age of those who died was 42. By comparison, the
national life expectancy rate is 76 years. Of those who died in the
past year, 134 were men, 22 women and one was transgendered, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 12,000 to 14,000 homeless people live on San Francisco's
streets, but there are fewer than 2,000 shelter beds available.
