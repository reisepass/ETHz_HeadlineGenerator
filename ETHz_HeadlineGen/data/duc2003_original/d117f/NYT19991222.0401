   In Denver, five were pummeled to death and two more beheaded. In
Richmond, Va., one was beaten, stabbed and beheaded, his head then
carried nearly a mile and placed for display on a footbridge. In
Seattle, one was stabbed 18 times, another beaten bloody, then
stabbed.
</P>
<P>
   There were others. One in Dallas, pelted with bullets from a
12-gauge shotgun for rummaging through trash. One in Chico, Calif.,
beaten to death for begging for spare change. Three in Portland,
Ore., strangled for who knows what.
</P>
<P>
   They were all homeless people killed over the last year. And
these were just the killings that made the news. Exactly how many
homeless people have been victims of savage attacks is unknown.
Police departments do not tabulate crimes against homeless people,
and in many cases, such as several beatings that have frightened
the large homeless population in San Francisco, those who survive
attacks often do not report them.
</P>
<P>
   What appears certain, advocates for the homeless say, is that
living on the streets is becoming more dangerous. In the last few
years, police departments across the country have reported more
frequent, more vicious attacks on those who are homeless. Nearly
always, the victims are ambushed as they sleep. Nearly as often,
the suspects, who are not always caught, are described as young men
who appear to attack for no reason. In some cases, suspects call it
``bum-bashing'' or ``troll-busting,'' police and advocates for the
homeless say.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks against homeless people rarely get attention, but
nationally, violence against people who are unsheltered is becoming
so common that the National Coalition for the Homeless is asking
Congress to consider ``homeless people'' as a maligned minority, or
protected class, in drafting any new legislation against hate
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have always been isolated instances of homeless people
being set on fire,'' said Michael Stoops, a community organizer for
the National Coalition. ``But what we're seeing now is a trend. And
what's most disturbing is that the likely suspects continue to be
young people.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on news reports, the coalition has counted 29 homeless
people who were killed in 1999 in 11 cities, from San Francisco to
Richmond, Va. It listed six others who barely survived attacks. The
youngest suspects in these cases were 14 years old, and most were
under 21.
</P>
<P>
   No one can say for sure why young people in particular seem to
be attacking homeless people in increasing numbers. But looking at
arrests in cases of violence against homeless people over several
years, by far the majority of the suspects were young teen-agers,
or even pre-teen-age boys, who bragged about the attacks afterward.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, for example, a 14-year-old middle school student was
convicted in March in the death of a 50-year-old homeless man. The
youth struck the victim repeatedly with a skateboard, robbed him,
then stabbed him to death with a pocket knife. He was caught a week
later, when witnesses told police he had been boasting about
killing a ``bum.'' In that same city, three teen-agers were charged
in August with the murder of a 46-year-old homeless man as he tried
to sleep beneath an interstate overpass. Prosecutors said that one
told friends, ``Let's just say there's one less bum on the face of
the Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   John Urquhart, a spokesman for the King County sheriff's office,
which covers Seattle, said he believed that the homeless were
singled out probably because they are accessible, anonymous and
stigmatized as ``throwaways of society.''
</P>
<P>
   Many advocates for the homeless blame increasing crackdowns on
homeless people for sitting, sleeping or lying in public spaces as
a significant factor in the increased attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, a homeless man was doused with a flammable chemical
and set aflame as he slept on a park bench in July. He suffered
third-degree burns over 20 percent of his body. John Donahue,
executive director of the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless, said
that he had noticed more of these kinds of attacks with the
increased gentrification of the city, the fencing of lower Wacker
Drive, where an encampment of homeless people had lived undisturbed
for years, and the increased police enforcement of laws designed to
keep people off the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the underpinning of these hate crimes,'' he said. ``It
legitimizes them because these people don't count. These people are
criminals for being poor _ that's what the official position is
saying about these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoops of the National Coalition said that when he visits high
schools and asks students what they think about homeless people,
they often call them bums and drunks who are too lazy to work.
``We're obviously sending a message to our young people that
homeless people are not worthy of their respect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, where the only suspects in a spate of seven slayings
since September are a 16-year-old, an 18-year-old and a 20-year-old
charged with murder for the death of one victim (and accused of the
nonfatal beatings of five other homeless people), police are
investigating talk on the streets that a pack of young men has been
picking on homeless people for thrills. In the only case so far
with a witness, police said that someone reported several juvenile
male suspects beating a homeless man in a downtown alley.
</P>
<P>
   The perpetrators, said Lt. Judith Will of the Denver Police
Department, ``may get a sort of high or thrill by beating up
people, and homeless are such an easy target.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, instances where homeless people are
murdered simply because they provide convenient targets for a
deranged person. Such was the case in San Francisco last year, when
a man who believed he was a vampire slashed the throats of four
homeless people, one fatally, and then drank their blood.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, as one in San Francisco earlier this year where
a homeless man standing on a corner was killed by a bullet meant
for someone else, the victim is a bystander. And because many
people on the streets are mentally ill or drug addicted or both,
they are easier to victimize and harder to help, police say, since
they are often unable to describe the time and place of their
attacks or their attackers.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, police say that they can find no evidence of
attacks. In Rapid City, S.D., eight homeless men have drowned in a
trout stream in less than two years, including three this year. The
Rapid City Police Department initially considered the cases
accidental drownings because the men all had high blood alcohol
levels. But homeless men have insisted that the victims, six of
whom were Native Americans, had actually been pushed into the
stream by racist white youths while the victims lay passed out from
alcohol. Police Chief Tom Hennies said that the department, with
help from state and federal law-enforcement officials, is now
considering the drownings possible homicides, ``even though we
don't have a shred of physical proof.''
</P>
<P>
   In Anchorage, where three homeless people were murdered this
year, at least a dozen older, homeless men have said they were
attacked by bands of marauding youths. But they were not able to
provide concrete details of the crimes or suspects, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The only comprehensive survey done on violence against homeless
people was a study in New York City in 1994, after several attacks
where youths set fire to sleeping homeless people. The survey found
that 80 percent of homeless people had been victims of violent
crime.
</P>
<P>
   While there have been no spectacular incidents of violence
against homeless people in New York since the survey was done, Mary
Ann Brosnahan, director of the New York Coalition for the Homeless,
said the coalition occasionally hears anecdotal reports of
harassment. ``We know that homeless people are far more likely to
be the victims of violent crime,'' she said, ``than the
perpetrators.''
