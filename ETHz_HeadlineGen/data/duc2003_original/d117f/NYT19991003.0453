   SAN FRANCISCO _ In Milwaukee, homeless people can be arrested
for sleeping on heating grates. In Atlanta, more than 60 people
died on the streets last year. In the farmland city of
Jeffersonville, Ind., a homeless mother, father and their infant
died last month when their shelter was firebombed.
</P>
<P>
   When organizers of a national conference on homelessness wanted
a city to illustrate how ``mean-spirited'' the nation's treatment
of those without housing has become, they picked San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 housing advocates from around the country joined more
than 100 San Francisco activists at the United Nations Plaza on
Saturday to protest what they call a growing problem of civil
rights abuses against street people.
</P>
<P>
   They called for an end to aggressive police policies which, they
said, allow the harassment of homeless people or simply push them
from neighborhood to neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a growing intolerance of the homeless around the
nation,'' said Bill Faith, board president of the National
Coalition for the Homeless, which held its annual meeting in San
Francisco last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the reason the coalition wanted to come to San
Francisco is because we have heard for years about the civil rights
abuses that go on here that are more egregious than most cities'
(abuses) in the country,'' said Faith, who is from Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   In January, San Francisco was one of five cities named as being
especially tough on the homeless, relying on the police to harass
street people rather than employing social service programs to find
health care, jobs and homes for them, said the report by the
National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The center also criticized Atlanta, Chicago, New York and
Tucson, Ariz., for ``criminalizing'' rather than treating
homelessness. It is the group's fifth report since 1991 on
homelessness in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters at the San Francisco demonstration used skits, chants
and banners to call on leaders around the nation to focus on
long-term solutions to homelessness: affordable housing and better
access to drug treatment and mental health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homelessness is being treated like ... an animal-control
problem,'' Max Biddel, a homeless advocate from Sacramento, told
the crowd of 200 protesters gathered at United Nations Plaza. He
stood in front of a row of shopping carts, decorated with banners
reading, ``Warning: push this cart and risk arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All people have the right to exist in this country, even if it
means sleeping in tents or sleeping bags,'' he told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, advocates for the homeless have been angered
by numerous police sweeps clearing street people from public parks
and plazas, and a series of proposals aimed at controlling
panhandling and the use of shopping carts by the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Willie Brown has defended the sweeps as an improvement of
quality of life in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates said homeless people are facing similar problems
around the nation _ from New York City with its massive homeless
problem, to Jeffersonville, a town of 29,000 in which aid agencies
served 1,300 homeless people last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Local governments around the country are implementing the same
kind of repressive programs,'' said Paul Boden, executive director
of the Coalition on Homelessness in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're sweeping their streets (of people), closing their
parks, confiscating shopping carts. Basically towns are doing
everything they can to put signs up around their borders saying,
`No poor people allowed.'''
</P>
<P>
   Coalition members called for a federal effort to deal with
homelessness by creating jobs, building affordable housing and
making health care accessible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to stop the harassment of homeless people on the
streets,'' said Faith, who runs a homeless program in Columbus
serving up to 15,000 people each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not saying that cities should just tolerate homeless
parks. There needs to be more than that. People want real options
for improving their lives,'' he said.
