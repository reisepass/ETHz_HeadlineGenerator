	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's homeless people are increasingly  
being harassed by police, driven from the streets in which they beg 
and sleep by cities putting ``meanness'' ahead of compassion, an 
advocacy group's report contends. 
</P>
<P>
	Many cities are bent on ``criminalizing homelessness'' and are  
failing to take advantage of existing constructive methods to treat 
homeless people for physical and mental problems and get them into 
housing and jobs, says the report by the National Law Center on 
Homelessness and Poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	But affordable housing remains a principal barrier, according to  
the report released Monday. It is the fifth such report issued 
since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``While cities continue to crack down on homeless people,  
resources to shelter homeless people or to help them to become 
self-sufficient are sorely lacking,'' the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of sending in the police to move and arrest these  
people, you can provide resources,'' said Maria Foscarinis, the 
center's executive director. ``Criminalizing is a quick fix, but 
it's not a solution. People have to go somewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report says many cities are turning to their police forces  
to enforce new or old laws that limit the use of public space and 
restrict begging. They are targeting the homeless for selective 
enforcement of the law and conducting sweeps to physically remove 
them, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	It cited five cities -- Atlanta, Chicago, New York, San Francisco  
and Tucson, Ariz. -- as being especially tough on the homeless and 
``promoting the `meanest' streets.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The report makes these assertions:  
</P>
<P>
	--Atlanta: ``Sweeps and crackdowns continue to occur with  
homeless people being removed from under bridges and moved along in 
the downtown area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Chicago: The city ``has made a concerted effort to arrest and  
prosecute homeless people for panhandling'' and is trying to remove 
them altogether from certain areas. 
</P>
<P>
	--New York City: ``There continues to be a crackdown on homeless  
people as the mayor focuses on `quality of life' violations; sweeps 
continue on an almost nightly basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--San Francisco: ``From January to November 1998 the police  
issued over 16,000 `quality of life' violation tickets, the 
majority of which were issued to homeless people. Police are taking 
pictures of people they claim are `habitual drinkers' ... and 
distributing them to liquor stores.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Tucson: ``City officials fully accept the criminalization  
policy; council members proposed looking into a plan to privatize 
the sidewalks which would allow business owners to keep homeless 
people off the sidewalks. Some homeless people were released from 
jail with travel restrictions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Some concerns about public space are legitimate,'' the report  
says. ``Ultimately, no city resident -- homeless or housed -- wants 
people living and begging in the streets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it contends that rather than turning to the police, ``cities  
must concentrate on efforts to alleviate the problem of 
homelessness rather than concentrating on the symptoms of the 
problem.''
