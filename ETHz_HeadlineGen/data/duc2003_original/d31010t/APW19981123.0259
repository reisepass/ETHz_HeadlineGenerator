	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ An Arctic cold wave that hit Poland a week
ago has killed 32 people, police said Monday.
	   Most of the victims were middle-aged men who had been drinking
alcohol and passed out in the cold, according to Grazyna Puchalska
of the national police headquarters. Other victims included
homeless people, according to police.
	   Temperatures in central and eastern Poland over the weekend were
as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit).
	   The lowest temperature reported was minus 26 Celsius (minus 15
Fahrenheit) early Sunday in Ostroleka in northeast Poland.
	   The cold wave hit on Nov. 16, making it one of the coldest
Novembers in Poland in recent years. Weather forecasters predict
higher temperatures in the next few days.
