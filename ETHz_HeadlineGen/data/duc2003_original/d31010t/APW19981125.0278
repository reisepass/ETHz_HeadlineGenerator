	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Krzysztof Chmiel knows about being
homeless and drinking, so his explanation for the 47 deaths as of
Wednesday in Poland's Arctic cold wave sounds plausible.
	   ``They drink methylated spirit and then drop dead,'' said the
46-year-old Chmiel, bundled up in a long, heavy coat at a Warsaw
homeless shelter. ``Methylated spirit warms you up really quickly,
but you also cool down quickly.''
	   The frigid Arctic air that moved in last week has claimed more
than 90 lives across Europe, including 30 in Romania and some in
France, Bulgaria and Italy. Croatia reported its first cold-related
death Wednesday, a woman who lived alone in an unheated house.
	   Temperatures have dropped well below freezing, with minus 26
Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit) recorded in Poland on Sunday. On
Wednesday, Poland's low was minus 12 Celsius (10 Fahrenheit).
Romania recorded minus 10 Celsius (14 Fahrenheit) as blizzards
swept across its southeast on Tuesday.
