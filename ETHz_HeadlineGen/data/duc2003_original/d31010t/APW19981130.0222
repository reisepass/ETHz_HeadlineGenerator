	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Unusually cold weather in Moscow killed at least
39 people in November, medical officials said on Monday.
	   Winter has come early to the Russian capital this year, with
temperatures below freezing through most of the month.
	   Since the beginning of October, 45 people have died of
hypothermia, the city ambulance service said, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   In addition, 143 people were hospitalized with hypothermia and
51 with frostbite, it said. One man was injured by a falling
icicle, but he was not hospitalized.
	   Cold claims dozens of lives in Moscow each winter. The majority
of victims are homeless people or alcoholics who pass out on the
street.
