	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Two more victims of Poland's prolonged
cold front were found Thursday, raising the death toll from more
than two weeks of freezing temperatures to at least 74.
	   Police said a 40-year-old man was found frozen to death in
central Poland on Thursday morning. A second man was found
overnight in Elblag province in northern Poland, near Gdansk.
	   Most victims have been the homeless or men who passed out from
drinking.
	   The cold front arrived on Nov. 16 with temperatures dipping as
low as minus 26 Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit). It already has
claimed 20 more lives than the number of cold-related deaths in all
of last winter, police say.
