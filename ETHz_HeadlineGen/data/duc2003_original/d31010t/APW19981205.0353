	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The death toll from almost three weeks of
sub-zero temperatures has reached 83, after a homeless man froze to
death in a Warsaw park.
	   The man, identified only as Adam S., 47, was discovered Friday
night, police said.
	   Poland's extreme cold began Nov. 16, with temperatures dropping
to minus 26 Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit). Police say the number of
cold-related deaths in recent weeks is 29 more than the number for
all of last winter, with most victims homeless or passed out from
alcohol.
