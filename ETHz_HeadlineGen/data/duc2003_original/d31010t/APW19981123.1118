	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ An Arctic cold wave and accompanying
blizzards have killed at least 65 people throughout Europe, police
and media reported Monday.
	   The weather played a role in at least 24 deaths in Romania and
Bulgaria over the past three days. In Poland, 36 people died, most
of them homeless or others who passed out in the cold after
drinking alcohol, police said.
	   Earlier police said 32 people throughout Poland had died of cold
exposure thus far, but by evening more deaths were reported.
	   A man was found in Debin, near Czestochowa, some 217 kilometers
(134 miles) south of Warsaw and two men were found dead near Lodz,
133 kilometers (82 miles) southwest of Warsaw. A report on the
fourth death was incomplete, police said.
