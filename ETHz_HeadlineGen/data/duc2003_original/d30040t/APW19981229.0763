	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel has threatened to close down the
Palestinian-run Gaza airport over a security violation, an Israeli
official said Tuesday, a move that could further undermine the
already fragile peace process.
	   Palestinian airport workers refused to allow Israeli security
officials to check the identity of passengers who arrived on an
Egyptian plane Sunday afternoon, most of whom worked for the
Palestinian Authority, according to Civilian Airport Authority
Director Nir Yarkoni.
	   ``The Transportation Minister asked me to tell the Palestinians
that if this continues, we won't allow the airport operate,'' he
told The Associated Press.
	   Yarkoni said he conveyed the message in a letter Monday to
chairman of the Palestinian Civil Aviation Authority Brig. Gen.
Fayez Zeidan.
	   Zeidan was not immediately available for comment.
	   Israel retains security control over flights arriving to Gaza
International Airport.
	   The airport's opening last month, stipulated by the accords
brokered by U.S. President Bill Clinton at Wye River, Maryland in
October, was hailed by Palestinians as a milestone toward
independence and statehood.
	   Since then, Israel has accused the Palestinians of failing to
contain anti-Israel violence, and has frozen the accords. The
Palestinians, in turn, accuse Israel of reneging on an agreement to
release Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel activities.
