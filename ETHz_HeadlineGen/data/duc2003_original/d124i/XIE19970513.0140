HONG KONG, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong doctors and nurses are
called on to donate their one-day income earned on June 2, 1997, to
Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), a world-wide medical relief
organization dedicated to saving lives in extreme circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Alain Guilloux, executive director of MSF, said: "This will be
the first time that Hong Kong doctors and nurses unite with MSF to
help save lives around the world."
</P>
<P>
Over 2,000 doctors and nurses are now working for MSF in over
70 countries to help victims of disasters and wars. So far, three
Hong Kong doctors and two nurses have volunteered to work for MSF
in Africa for six to nine months.
</P>
<P>
"Since few doctors can afford to leave their practice in Hong
Kong for such a long time, we have, therefore, set aside June 2,
1997, as our Medical Day when they can volunteer to give up one day
of their income to support those MSF volunteers currently working
in the field," said Guilloux.
</P>
<P>
The appeal has won support from more than 20 local doctors and
nurses, including prominent members of the medical profession in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Arthur K C Li, chancellor of the Chinese University of
Hong Kong, said: "We are involved in a compassionate profession,
which needs a sense of service and sacrifice, and which is not
only a means of business."
</P>
<P>
Professor S. P. Chow, dean of Faculty of Medicine of the
University of Hong Kong, who once worked as a volunteer doctor of
MSF in the Vietnamese refugee camps, also called on his colleges
to lend a helping hand. Hong Kong now has 8,000 registered doctors
and 28,000 registered nurses.
</P>
<P>
MSF did not set a target for fund raising on June 2, 1997, said
the executive director, who hoped to donate part of the money to
the needy in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1971, MSF has offered medical assistance to
Vietnamese refugees in Hong Kong, and some areas stricken by
natural disasters in China.
