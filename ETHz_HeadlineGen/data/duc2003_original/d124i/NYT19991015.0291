   ATLANTA _ They might not be at the podium when the award is
formally presented, but in a large way, Drs. Susan Goldstein and
Suzanne Cotter shared in the Nobel Peace Prize announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Both doctors work at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta,
and both are among the thousands of physicians who have volunteered
for Doctors Without Borders, the French-based medical relief group
that won the prize.
</P>
<P>
   Ten idealistic and somewhat brash young doctors from France
started the organization in 1971. Today, thanks to volunteers like
Goldstein and Cotter, Doctors Without Borders provides medical
assistance in more than 80 countries. In all, about 2,000
physicians and medical personnel from 45 countries are working with
the organization. Projects include performing surgery on gunshot
victims in Sierra Leone, improving sanitation in East Timor,
providing anesthesia in Kosovo and striving to prevent cholera in
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   The staff and volunteers are famous for working with little
regard for their personal safety. The organization _ which is also
known by its French name, Medecins Sans Frontieres _ has taken
risks as well, defying governments that hinder humanitarian
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In following that committed path, Doctors Without Borders ``has
adhered to the fundamental principle that all disaster victims,
whether the disaster is natural or human in origin, have a right to
professional assistance,'' the Nobel committee said, announcing its
decision in Oslo, Norway.
</P>
<P>
   The award confirms ``the fundamental right of ordinary people''
to medical care and protection, said Dr. James Orbinski, president
of Doctors Without Borders. He quickly added that the honor goes to
many people, especially donors and ``each of our volunteers and
national staff who every day ensure that the right to humanitarian
assistance remains a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Offered congratulations for her share in that recognition, the
CDC's Goldstein laughed. She said her mother called to wake her up
Friday morning with news that the group had won.
</P>
<P>
   A medical epidemiologist in the CDC's hepatitis branch,
Goldstein volunteered with Doctors Without Borders last year. She
spent seven months in a remote area of Ethiopia, where she
developed a program for diagnosing and treating a parasitic disease
called visceral leishmaniasis, or kala-azar.
</P>
<P>
   Through such programs, Doctors Without Borders has saved
thousands of lives in Ethiopia, she said. Joining in the effort
``was one of the best experiences of my life, the best thing I ever
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Cotter, who is from Dublin, Ireland, but currently a fellow in
epidemiology at the CDC, volunteered with Medecins Sans Frontieres
on the other side of the globe from Goldstein. In 1989, she spent
six months helping provide health clinics for Vietnamese boat
people in Hong Kong refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   The organization might have been better known in Europe than in
the United States when she was participating, said Cotter, 39. But
she was impressed with its sound organization then. In the years
since, it has filled in the gaps in so many medical emergencies
that it definitely deserves the Nobel, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to providing medical services and training, Doctors
Without Borders has assumed another important role, too, added
Goldstein, 38. Witnessing and speaking out about human rights
violations is a major emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   The group's founders _ impatient with the timidity of some other
organizations _ have always said the right to intervene is a moral
imperative. They believed some humanitarian groups were too
reticent to challenge governments that hindered their efforts, and
they valued the role of the media in shedding light on the plight
of people in peril.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that belief, Doctors Without Borders volunteers have
spoken out over the years against genocide, war crimes and crimes
against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The Nobel committee recognized that role by praising the group
for helping ``to form bodies of public opinion opposed to
violations and abuses of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, far from every Doctors Without Borders program is likely to
grab headlines. While the group is active in such high-profile
crises as Kosovo and East Timor, Goldstein said, it is just as
vigorously attending to health needs in places far from the
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   There could be more of those places soon: The Nobel Peace Prize,
to be presented in ceremonies in Oslo on Dec. 10, is worth nearly
$1 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this amount of money,'' the group's Secretary-General
Jean-Marie Kindermans told the BBC on Friday, ``we will work more
for forgotten populations, which is the more difficult situation to
get funds for.''
