 &UR; Doctors Without Borders gives accounts of gruesome Serb torture

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The civilian population of Kosovo has been
subjected to a ``systematic policy of terror'' that includes
massacres, decapitations and cutting off ears, according to a
report by the humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders published
Tuesday.
	   In a faxed statement summarizing the report, Doctors Without
Borders said that civilians, villages and goods like tractors
necessary for survival ``appear to be the deliberate targets of
(Serb) military operations.''
	   In an article giving further details of the report, the daily Le
Monde described accounts of such terror obtained by volunteers of
the Paris-based aid group between Sept. 23 and Oct. 5 in the area
covering the Pec, Prizren and Drenica valley regions.
	   Efforts to help victims were hindered by the destruction of the
medical infrastructure and persecution of local doctors, Doctors
Without Borders said.
	   Le Monde provided a detailed account by volunteers of Doctors
Without Borders of the gruesome acts of terror allegedly carried
out by Serb soldiers and police, who in several cases bartered
civilians' lives for gold jewelry or cash payments.
	   One account, dated Oct. 5 from the Klodernica region, quotes a
mother of one family saying Serb militias, arriving in the ``Valley
of Apples,'' doused children's clothes with gasoline to frighten
them and took women's jewelry.
	   A family from the Vucac Valley recounts militia demanding money
to save the men's lives. ``In front of our eyes, they cut the ears
off a man they found in the mountains and put them in our hands,''
said an aunt, not identified by name. Three men were then killed in
a ditch before their eyes, she added.
	   The father of the same family, named Osman, is quoted as saying
that in the village of Obrije, ``I buried 13 people in a day.''
	   ``One had no head. His brain was smashed,'' Osman was quoted as
saying. ``On that day, we saw some horrible things.
	   ``I saw an 80-year-old woman, her ears cut. A 17-member family,
all killed ....''
	   ``In each offensive, first the military came with tanks, then
the police. You'd think they were programmed to kill.''
	   In Obrije, the man said, the militia took over a household,
killing three men and cutting off their ears. They asked a woman to
watch over the children while they ``played all night with the
bodies. An 18-year-old girl who tried to escape was killed and
``her eyes torn out,'' Osman was quoted as saying.
	   The account did not explain how Osman was made aware of the
scene.
