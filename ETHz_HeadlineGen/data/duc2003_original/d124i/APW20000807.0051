   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Accusing the United Nations of
allowing ethnic cleansing to persist in Kosovo, the Belgian branch
of the humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders announced Monday
it was ceasing operations in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors Without Borders ''can no longer tolerate the serious and
continuous deterioration of living conditions of the ethnic
minorities in Kosovo,'' the group said in a statement released in
Pristina. French teams from Doctors Without Borders will remain in
the province.
</P>
<P>
   The group said the Belgian doctors had been ''eyewitnesses to
the daily harassment and terror against the Serb minority in (the
towns of) Vucitrn and Srbica and the Albanian minority in (the
northern part of Kosovska) Mitrovica.''
</P>
<P>
   The group said life for ethnic minorities was marked by
killings, drive-by shootings, hand grenade attacks, verbal abuse,
threats, robbery and blackmail. Many had been forced to leave their
homes, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year after NATO and the United Nations marched into
Kosovo, mistrust and violence still fester between ethnic
Albanians, Serbs and other minority groups. International officials
make almost daily appeals for tolerance, saying ethnic tensions are
preventing the southern Serb province from achieving economic and
social progress.
</P>
<P>
   ''Doctors Without Borders questions the appropriateness of
humanitarian medical and psychological assistance when, in the
presence of internationally mandated protection forces, the
fundamental rights of people are being denied,'' the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Paris-based group, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize
in 1999, has worked in Kosovo since 1993. It provides home-based
care in the ethnically divided city of Kosovska Mitrovica.
