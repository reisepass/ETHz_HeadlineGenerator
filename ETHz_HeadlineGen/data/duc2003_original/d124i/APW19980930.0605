	   HONG KONG (AP) _ An international relief agency announced
Wednesday that it is withdrawing from North Korea because the
government has ordered it to stop treating starving and sick people
and to supply the local pharmaceutical industry instead.
	   ``We are being forced to pull out, and we don't understand
why,'' said Dr. Dominique Lafontaine of Doctors Without Borders, a
European charity. ``They do not acknowledge the fact that there is
huge humanitarian need'' because of famine.
	   The agency recently withdrew 11 of its 13 professionals,
including nine doctors, when talks with the communist government
broke down. It said the last two were leaving Wednesday.
	   Doctors Without Borders is one of about half a dozen relief
agencies that have set up operations within North Korea to help the
secretive country cope with its 3-year-old famine.
	   In early August, the Paris-based Doctors of the World left North
Korea when the government denied it access to a large population of
malnourished and sick children. Lafontaine said Chesci, an Italian
medical and agricultural aid organization, also pulled out because
of restrictions on its movements and who it could treat.
	   But the International Red Cross is continuing its work there,
said Enkas Chau, a Red Cross international relief service officer
based in Hong Kong. He said the organization has been able to cover
its target areas across the country because of its working
relationship with the North Korean Red Cross.
	   In Rome, Tom Shortley, North Korea desk officer at the World
Food Program, said the situation there was difficult but gradually
improving, and he hoped Doctors Without Borders would return.
	   He added, ``I think from our perspective _ and we've always
approached the children as our top priority _ you have to keep
engaged, you have to keep pressing the authorities for access.''
	   The World Food Program ships food to North Korea and monitors
the government's distribution to see whether the food is going to
target groups, mainly children.
	   U.S. officials who toured some of the hardest-hit regions of
North Korea this summer said 2 million North Koreans _ nearly 10
percent of the population _ may have died in the famine.
	   It was caused by two years of flooding and a drought that
devastated the country's inefficient state-run farming system.
	   Food shortages and widespread public health problems appear to
have left every sector of the nation's economy in ruins, except the
gigantic military that North Korea maintains.
	   That has left the country's 23 million people largely dependent
on foreign aid. But the government often frustrates relief agencies
by setting restrictions on how they can operate, where they can go
and which sectors of the public they can treat.
	   The government also has prevented many foreign journalists from
entering the country, which sometimes reduces the amount of money
that relief agencies can raise from the rest of the world.
	   Dr. Eric Goemaere, director-general of Doctors Without Borders,
said that it was ``forced to pull out'' its last two remaining
doctors when North Korean officials told the organization to stop
distributing medical aid.
	   The agency was forced to shut down its 1,400 health centers in
four provinces north of Pyongyang, where it was providing the
nation with basic medical equipment and medicines that it lacks,
and helping to train local doctors and health workers.
	   Doctors Without Borders also helped more than 15,000 children at
64 feeding centers in the provinces. But Goemaere and Lafontaine
said that restrictions on whom the relief agency could feed often
left them frustrated.
	   ``Without any antiseptics or antibiotics, the people will be
forced to go back to'' ineffective herbal medicines, said Goemaere.
	   Despite the prospects of a grim winter, North Korean officials
had asked the agency to focus on supplying raw materials and
chemicals for the production of basic antibiotics at the country's
own dysfunctional plants.
	   For instance, Goemaere said, such plants need large supplies of
acid derivatives and raw penicillin to produce something as simple
as basic aspirin and antibiotics.
	   The country's hospitals are so ill-equipped that Lafontaine said
that abortions and appendectomies are being performed without
antiseptics, anesthesia, or even gloves. Incisions are being made
using ordinary scissors, and intravenous infusions are being
applied with homemade tubes and bottle drips.
	   Lafontaine said many hospitals and clinics outside Pyongyang
suffer severe power outages and lack of clean water, forcing many
to drink from polluted rivers and streams. Many people are
suffering from typhoid and intestinal infections, he said.
	   ``We know some hospitals are refusing to take patients because
the problem is too great,'' said Lafontaine.
	   Earlier reports from North Korea have accused the government of
using donations to feed the military and government loyalists,
leaving other people without any aid at all.
	   Goemaere urged other relief agencies to remain in North Korea,
but to fight the restrictions they face by demanding concessions
before more aid is sent in.
