	   ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar (AP) -- Madagascar's battle against a cholera
epidemic is being complicated by a spat between the government of one of the
world's poorest countries and an acclaimed international aid agency.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 1,000 Malagasies -- as residents of this Indian Ocean island are
called -- have died since the epidemic erupted a year ago, according to official
figures. Most health officials believe the death toll is higher, even as the
government said Wednesday the epidemic is ``diminishing.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a battle on the sidelines, the Swiss section of Doctors Without Borders
announced Tuesday it was abandoning its cholera-fighting operations in the
country because the government refused it access to victims.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The reason they gave (was) `We the people of Madagascar can care for our
own population,''' said Thomas Nierle, a Doctors Without Borders official. ``I
think it's a question of sovereignty. It's a lot of pride. It's almost
arrogant.''
</P>
<P>
	   The government, for its part, made a similar accusation against Doctors
Without Borders, which won the Nobel Peace Prize last year for bringing medical
aid to conflict areas worldwide.
</P>
<P>
	   ''(Doctors Without Borders) has treated us like a war-torn country with no
ability to conduct its own health initiatives, dictating what we do,'' Armand
Ralaidovy, the Health Ministry's coordinator for combating cholera, said in an
interview. ``Their statement was derogatory.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have more than 2,000 doctors. We have the health infrastructure,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ralaidovy said the government was ably handling the epidemic. But some of
the criticism has come from Madagascar's own doctors.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, a local association of doctors known by its French acronym
SEDODIA called for Heath Minister Henriette Rahantalalao to resign, saying she
was bungling the handling of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
	   Soon after the epidemic broke out, the Ministry of Defense erected
roadblocks on major highways. All travelers were required to take heavy doses of
oral antibiotics in a move many critics said was ineffective and even dangerous.
Giving antibiotics to those without cholera serves no purpose, and raises the
general population's resistance to the drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   The roadblocks were taken down on Nov. 26, but were put back up a few weeks
ago and only travelers complaining of diarrhea were then given the antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
	   This Texas-sized island off southeast Africa is known to the 100,000-plus
tourists who visit annually for its unspoiled beaches, virgin rain forests and
sightings of lemurs and humpback whales. But behind the pristine attractions lie
poverty and unsanitary living conditions -- a breeding ground for cholera.
</P>
<P>
	   Only one in three people have access to clean water in Madagascar, the 13th
poorest nation on the planet. Only 3 percent have access to flush toilets. Most
even lack the money to buy charcoal to boil water, a critical step in preventing
cholera, an acute intestinal infection that causes copious diarrhea, which can
quickly lead to dehydration and death.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, 16 patients with severe diarrhea checked into the dim,
run-down Befelatanana Hospital in Antananarivo. A crowded roomful of listless
men, women and children were laid out on cots with IV cords dangling above them.
</P>
<P>
	   A notice in an office around the corner reminded medical personnel to
require relatives to take special precautions in burying the bodies of cholera
victims, to prevent more infections.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors said about 50 cholera patients were in the hospital, down from more
than 100 in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   The Health Ministry said Wednesday the worst of the epidemic was over.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The outbreak has peaked and now is diminishing because of our
interventions,'' Ralaidovy said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   But Nierle, who recently completed a 13-month tour of duty in Madagascar and
was interviewed by phone from Geneva, said there were no signs the epidemic was
slowing.
</P>
<P>
	   A total of 18,809 suspected cholera cases have been identified in the past
year in Madagascar, the government said. A reported 1,070 people have died.
