	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Doctors Without Borders, which  
revolutionized private aid by asserting a right to intervene in any 
country to treat the wounded, sick and starving, won the 1999 Nobel 
Peace Prize today. 
</P>
<P>
	The volunteer organization -- officially called by its French  
name Medecins Sans Frontieres -- has played a major role in Africa, 
as well as war zones throughout the world, breaking down barriers 
to reach those in need. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm thinking of all the people who died without aid, of all  
those who died waiting for someone to knock on their door,'' 
Bernard Kouchner, one of the group's founders who now serves as the 
top U.N. representative in Kosovo, told France Info radio after 
hearing of the award. 
</P>
<P>
	Kouchner was one of 10 idealistic French doctors who set up the  
group in 1971 because of their growing frustration at the quiet 
neutrality of the International Committee of the Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors Without Borders ``has adhered to the fundamental  
principle that all disaster victims, whether the disaster is 
natural or human in origin, have a right to professional assistance 
given as quickly and as efficiently as possible,'' the Norwegian 
Nobel Committee said in announcing the award. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors Without Borders has more than 2,000 medical  
professionals working in 80 countries. They hold as one of their 
most important tenets a ``right to intervene'' regardless of 
international policy toward a government. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been detractors, people who laughed at us, but  
that's normal,'' Kouchner said. ``They didn't understand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the Red Cross, Doctors Without Borders does place blame --  
on armed groups, harsh regimes, or governments -- for the suffering 
it finds. 
</P>
<P>
	Many, if not all of the doctors, including Kouchner, were born  
after World War II and were highly aware of the role Nazi death 
camp physicians played during the Holocaust. They were determined 
to change the role of doctors in wartime. 
</P>
<P>
	When Doctors Without Borders began sending physicians to  
conflicts, there were very few independent, privately funded 
humanitarian aid groups working worldwide. The group's actions have 
since been imitated by other organizations and have set the tone 
for independent humanitarian aid work. 
</P>
<P>
	In its nearly 30 years of existence, the organization's doctors  
and volunteers have traveled to disaster areas in Nicaragua, 
Vietnam, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Kosovo and now 
East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	``National boundaries and political circumstances or sympathies  
must have no influence on who is to receive humanitarian help. By 
maintaining a high degree of independence, the organization has 
succeeded in living up to these ideals,'' the committee said. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-member awards committee works in secrecy during its  
five or six meetings a year, and refuses to comment on or release 
candidates' names. This year it said only that there were 136 
nominees and the winner was selected on Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Some names were known because those making the nominations  
announce their candidates for the prize, which includes a cash 
award of $960,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In past years, favorites have emerged from world events and the  
committee's wish to nurture ongoing peace efforts. Last year, the 
Northern Ireland peace process was at a key junction and the prize 
went to Protestant David Trimble and Catholic John Hume. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 prize went to American Jody Williams and the  
International Campaign to Ban Landmines, the 1994 award to 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli leaders Yitzhak Rabin 
and Shimon Peres, and the 1993 prize was awarded to South Africa's 
Nelson Mandela and F.W. de Klerk. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time a peace prize went exclusively to a humanitarian  
field organization was in 1981, when the laureate was the Office of 
the U.N. Commissioner for Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	The selection of Doctors Without Borders was expected to  
generate little controversy. Before the announcement, speculation 
that a Chinese dissident, such as exiled pro-democracy activists 
Wei Jingsheng or Wang Dan, might win brought a furious response 
from Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	China called the men criminals, and warned against giving them  
the prestigious award. 
</P>
<P>
	After the winners were revealed, there was only praise for the  
humanitarian doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an honor for France,'' French President Jacques Chirac  
said from Tampere, Finland. ``It is fortunate that these people 
who, in a manner of speaking, epitomize a sort of progress in the 
universal conscience are rewarded today, and I'm very happy about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillipe Biberson, president of Medecins Sans Frontieres France,  
received word of the prize with pride, and a touch of apprehension. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting the prize might, in fact, complicate our work,'' he  
said. ``It's not clear that the institutionalization of 
humanitarian aid is the best way to defend endangered 
populations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prizes, first given in 1901, are always presented on the  
Dec. 10 anniversary of the death of their creator, Swedish 
industrialist Alfred Nobel. The peace prize is awarded in Oslo, and 
the others in Stockholm.
