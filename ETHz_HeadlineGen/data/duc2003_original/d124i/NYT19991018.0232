   BOSTON _ Evan Lee, an East Boston physician, will never forget
the malnourished, tuberculosis-ridden 15-year-old Somalian refugee
he helped save as a member of Doctors Without Borders, the
humanitarian group honored with the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rich, physician from Lynn, Mass., and another member of
the group, had such a moving experience treating patients whose
illnesses were aggravated by environmental conditions in Uzbekistan
that he is now studying public health at Harvard and hopes to go
abroad again.
</P>
<P>
   And David Kent, a Boston doctor and researcher, will always
remember his work in war-torn Bosnia, when ``the spirit of the
country was the lowest'' and ``people were really despairing
whether it would ever end.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of commitment by Lee, Rich, Kent, and the thousands of
other Doctors Without Borders volunteers from around the world _ to
go wherever war, famine, and other disasters strike _ prompted the
Nobel committee to recognize the group's ``pioneering humanitarian
work'' that rises above ``national boundaries and political
circumstances or sympathies.''
</P>
<P>
   The group, formally known as Medecins Sans Frontieres, was
founded in 1971 by French physicians who were frustrated at the
slow response and neutrality of traditional humanitarian
organizations toward refugee crises in developing countries. The
organization has provided a precedent for international
intervention in situations like Kosovo and East Timor in which
civilians are attacked by forces within their own countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Nobel committee cited the group's rapid response and its
willingness to place blame as helping ``to form bodies of public
opinion opposed to violations and abuses of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Orbinski of Doctors Without Borders used the prize as
an opportunity to remind the world of the horrors still going on
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``As entire families are chased from their homes in East Timor
and as thousands more are targeted in conflicts around the world
that don't make the headlines, the Nobel Prize is an important
confirmation of the fundamental right of ordinary people to
humanitarian assistance and protection,'' he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The group's volunteers, from doctors to nurses to engineers,
have served in 80 countries, ranging from Nicaragua to Vietnam,
Ethiopia to Kosovo, Rwanda to East Timor. Volunteers typically
serve several months at a time and work with local professionals in
their area of expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lee, 39, an internist at East Boston Neighborhood Health
Center, knows firsthand the ravages of war, with his multiple
stints in Africa for Doctors Without Borders.
</P>
<P>
   The patient he will never forget was a 15-year-old victim of
Somalia's civil war, whom he treated for malnutrition and
tuberculosis in a rudimentary field hospital in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a skeleton. She weighed 45 pounds. She literally
couldn't move. . . . I quite frankly didn't think she would make
it,'' recalled Lee, who was at the refugee camps in the early
1990s, and has also served in other parts of Africa in his two
years overseas.
</P>
<P>
   With medical treatment and the caring attention of her mother,
the girl pulled through, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This patient, this child who couldn't move, a month or two
later, she stood up. Things went very well from there. By the time
I left, she doubled her weight, and was a smiling, vivacious
15-year-old girl,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kent, 36, an assistant professor at New England Medical Center,
spent nearly six months in war-torn Bosnia in 1994, and was there
when the cease-fire was arranged and the Serbs withdrew their heavy
artillery from around Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country was far from recovered,'' he said. ``At least
there was some hope by the time I left.''
</P>
<P>
   By coincidence, a Doctors Without Borders exhibit of artwork by
Bosnian and Croatian children opened at Codman Square Health Center
in Boston two days ago. The exhibit runs through Nov. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Rich, 37, an internist at Lynn Community Health Center, came
away from his experience in Uzbekistan with a deep sense of
commitment to the group's mission.
</P>
<P>
   The group ``really has its heart in the right place,'' Rich
said. ``It really wants to help populations that are neglected.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first physician organization with links to
Massachusetts that has received the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1985, the
award went to the International Physicians for the Prevention of
Nuclear War, cofounded by Dr. Bernard Lown of Massachusetts and Dr.
Yevgeny Chazov of the Soviet Union.
