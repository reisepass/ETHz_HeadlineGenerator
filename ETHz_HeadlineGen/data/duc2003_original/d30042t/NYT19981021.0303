   SABRATHA, Libya _ Among majestic Roman ruins set against an
azure sea, Sebastian Cuisenier walked alone, a rare visitor to a
site that almost anywhere else in the world would be thronged with
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always liked pariah countries,'' Cuisenier, 27, a
Frenchman from Marseilles, said when asked why he had included
Libya to a two-month journey through the region. ``And I have a
certain sympathy for people who are battling against imperialism.''
</P>
<P>
   As unlikely as it may sound, at least for now, the Libyan
authorities are trying hard to persuade more people like Cuisenier
to take the same step. It was not until three years ago that Libya
even established a Ministry of Tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Under U.N. sanctions, which prohibit international flights, the
only way to reach the country is to travel overland or by ferry.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, Libyan officials say they have counted 88,000
visitors, about one-third as many as arrive in neighboring Egypt in
an average month, and Western diplomats say they suspect that even
this number may be inflated.
</P>
<P>
   But Libya, which earns 96 percent of its income from oil, has
nevertheless now pronounced tourism to be ``the industry of the
21st century.'' And if real and psychological barriers could be
removed, one diplomat said, ``the potential is absolutely
stunning.''
</P>
<P>
   Scattered along Libya's 1,100-mile Mediterranean coast are
Greek, Phoenician and Roman ruins that together comprise one of the
region's richest archaeological treasures.
</P>
<P>
   Sabratha, 45 minutes west of Tripoli, the capital, was first
inhabited by the Phoenicians in the sixth century B.C. and also
boasts a Roman theater restored in the 1920s by Italian experts.
</P>
<P>
   The largest collection of ruins, at Leptis Magna, 90 minutes to
Tripoli's east, are the remains of what was once a city of 100,000
people, and are listed by the United Nations as a World Heritage
Site.
</P>
<P>
   The beaches are described by foreign residents as the cleanest
in the Mediterranean. The vast desert includes another World
Heritage Site, the oasis of Ghadames, a trading post 400 miles
south of Tripoli that was first inhabited more than 4,000 years ago
by the ancient ancestors of today's Tuareg population. In Wadi
Mathendush, in the Akarkous Mountains, rock drawings can be found
that date from neolithic times.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, government officials say, they are making progress in
luring visitors to such sites. A crowd that gathered recently for a
cultural festival in Ghadames included the designer Pierre Cardin.
</P>
<P>
   Most tourists are retired, and many are Italians, curious about
a land that Italy colonized from 1911 to 1943, and willing to
endure the five-hour trip to Tripoli from Djerba, Tunisia, the
nearest international airport.
</P>
<P>
   Tour buses and visitors with cameras dangling from their necks
are no longer a strange site on Tripoli's streets, although both
are still scarce enough to satisfy those who have lost their
appetite for crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is almost empty, and I like quiet empty places,'' said
Francois Lemaire, 63, of Vendome, France. ``What I like most is
that I know there are very few tourists here, so it means I can
have some peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed Gattus, Libya's undersecretary of tourism, said that a
recent two-day conference held in Tripoli was intended to help
train local tour operators in order to put the industry ``on a
sound foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Cuisenier and others wryly pointed out, the obstacles to
travel within Libya _ particularly by independent visitors _ remain
considerable. The official exchange rate is wildly inflated, and
the government has not yet settled on a plan to establish a more
realistic rate for tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Distances are enormous, and most must be traveled by car. One
effect of the U.N. sanctions, imposed since 1992 because of Libya's
refusal to surrender suspects accused in the 1988 bombing of a Pan
Am airliner, has been to ground most of the country's domestic air
fleet.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the fact that tourism as a phenomenon has been
relatively recent, and that the ideology propounded by Col. Moammar
Gadhafi, the Libyan leader, declares their country is a ``state of
the masses,'' has created what Cuisenier described as ``not exactly
a service-oriented economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Libyan officials say they are confident that when and if
the U.N. sanctions are lifted, tourism may indeed become big
business. And ordinary Libyans say they are resentful that
animosity from the West, and particularly from the United States,
has served to overshadow what they regard as rich attractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``My message is simple: we cannot ignore America,'' Salah
el-Fathali, the executive director of the National Cancer
Institute, said during a chance encounter as he guided two visiting
French doctors around the Sabratha site. ``But at the same time,
you cannot ignore us.''
