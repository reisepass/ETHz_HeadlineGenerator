   SAN FRANCISCO _ All is not utopia in the brave new Internet flea
markets. Just ask the customers of Craig Lee Hare.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, the Federal Trade Commission charged Hare, of Lake
Worth, Fla., with fraud for collecting thousands of dollars from
buyers who responded to his bogus offers for used computer
equipment. Hare had posted ads on the popular eBay on-line auction
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities shut down Hare's operation, and he was
eventually convicted of fraud, sentenced to six months' home
detention, ordered to pay restitution of $22,000 and barred for
life from conducting business on Internet auctions.
</P>
<P>
   Hare's customers apparently aren't the only ones who have been
burned by on-line auction sites. In early January, the New York
City Department of Consumer Affairs began investigating eBay's
practices regarding the buying and selling of fake sports
memorabilia, including bogus autographed baseballs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these reports, on-line auction houses continue to be the
current Internet rage, creating a thriving home business meant for
people like Lela McKenna, 36, a mother of two in Castro Valley,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to work part-time at a store to earn spending money,''
McKenna said. ``But after a full Saturday shift, and after taxes, I
found myself coming home with $35.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, McKenna, a long-time toy collector, discovered
eBay while surfing the Web. After some initial sales from her
Barbie collection, McKenna quit her job and now spends her spare
time auctioning and buying Japanese fashion dolls and Asian comic
books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put in about an hour keeping up with my auctions, and I can
clear four or five hundred dollars,'' she said. ``I don't have to
cope with spending my afternoons restocking shelves.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors seem to agree with the San Jose-based eBay, which,
like most on-line auction houses, connects sellers and buyers in a
highest bid contest. As of Monday, eBay had $20.5 billion in market
capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   In traders' books, eBay is now worth more than Kmart and
Seattle's on-line bookseller Amazon.com, the legendary Web success
story.
</P>
<P>
   As auction sites proliferate _ there are nearly 200 auction
sites open on the Internet _ so do concerns about consumer fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, on-line auction fraud has become the most
common form of fraud on the Internet, according to the Internet
Fraud Watch, a division of the National Consumers League advocacy
group based in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Auction sites are popular right now, and as more and more
people come onto the Internet, they check the sites out,'' said
Cleo Manuel, a spokeswoman for Internet Fraud Watch. ``Con artists
naturally gravitate to what's popular and new.''
</P>
<P>
   The FTC has begun looking into the problem of protecting
consumers who use on-line auctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always advise people not to send money, like money orders
or cashier's check, for on-line purchases,'' said Eileen
Harrington, director for marketing practices with the FTC.
Harrington said that the nature of on-line auctions, like other
Internet transactions, seems to prompt some consumers to spend
money in reckless ways, giving scam artists new opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd never just talk to someone on the phone about a used car
you saw in a classified ad, then send him a check,'' Harrington
said, ``but people do that all the time on the Internet.''

   While the authorities chase down bad on-line auction site
sellers and try to figure out who exactly carries the liability for
on-line auction fraud, consumer advocates and auction sites are
publicizing safeguards that consumers can follow to keep themselves
from becoming victims.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a digest of some of those safeguards. Many of these tips
were gleaned from ``Going, Going, Burned!'' by Beth Laurence,
published in the current issue of Nolo News, the quarterly
publication of Berkeley-based Nolo Press, the legal self-help book
publisher.
</P>
<P>
   _ Educate yourself. All on-line auction sites have extensive
rules and frequently asked questions (FAQ) pages. Keep in mind that
different auction sites have different rules, so take the time to
read each site's information carefully. Also, check out the various
on-line auction chat rooms such as AuctionWatch
(www.auctionwatch.com) for talk of bum sites.
</P>
<P>
   _ Start small. You'll reduce your risk while you learn the
ropes. At eBay, free insurance guards transactions up to $200, with
a $25 deductible.
</P>
<P>
   _ Beware of shields and shills. A shill is auction talk for a
seller or friend of a seller who puts bogus bids on an item to
drive up its cost. A shield is someone who bids on an item to drive
up prices and drive away legitimate buyers. At the last minute, the
shield withdraws his or her bid, letting a co-conspirator get the
item at a lower cost. You can sometimes spot a shill or shield by
similarities in e-mail addresses between a seller and a high
bidder. The better defense is to avoid bidding wars.
</P>
<P>
   _ Know your market. Internet auctions don't automatically mean
bargains. Sellers are trying to get the highest price for their
goods and will hype their products in the descriptions. Compare
real-world prices at local stores and antiques shops before
bidding. Also, don't forget to factor in shipping costs while
you're bidding. Usually the buyer pays for delivery.
</P>
<P>
   _ Know your seller. Before the sale closes, phone the seller to
confirm condition of the goods, shipment methods and costs. Also,
check out the track record of your seller. Most auction sites have
feedback forums that list a history of the seller's transactions,
buyer satisfaction, etc.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep records. Print out everything relating to the sale,
including any e-mail you exchange with a seller, the original
posting of the item and any pictures included with the posting.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use an escrow service. After a bid is accepted, an escrow
company collects the buyer's payment. Those funds are released to
the seller after the buyer receives and inspects the item and finds
it satisfactory. Escrow services usually charge a small percentage
of the sale price, but are well worth it for expensive items.
Companies providing the service include I-escrow (www.iescrow.com)
and Tradesafe (www.tradesafe.com).
