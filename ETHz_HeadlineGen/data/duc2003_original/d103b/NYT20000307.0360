Internet auction pioneer eBay yesterday invested in used car seller
AutoTrader.com, and the two companies have created a co-branded Web
site for auctioning used vehicles.
<P>
   For now, the new site, www.ebay-autotrader.com, lists only 2,100
used cars, for sale by their owners or by dealers.
</P>
<P>
   However, Atlanta's AutoTrader.com has 1.5 million vehicles
listed for sale, and hopes ``to drive as many of our traditional
classified listings as possible into the auction style,'' said
AutoTrader.com chief executive Chip Perry.
</P>
<P>
   Although other online auto sellers, including Santa Clara's
AutoWeb.com, have launched used car auctions in the past year,
revenues have so far been small. Consumers are reluctant to bid on
vehicles that they have never seen, said Chris Denove, director of
auto analysis at market research firm J.D. Power and Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Denove believes that eBay and AutoTrader.com may be able to
overcome consumers' fears with a combination of eBay's well-known
seller rating system and AutoTrader.com's large base of consumers
and dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone could ever make an online vehicle auction
successful, it would be the marriage between eBay and AutoTrader &QL; 
.com,'' Denove said.
</P>
<P>
   The companies plan to introduce several measures _ third-party
inspections, warranties and escrow _ that will help assure car
buyers that they're not getting a lemon. As in eBay's current
Automotive category, shoppers can search for cars within a
geographical range or nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Financial details of the deal were not disclosed, but eBay's
investment in AutoTrader.com will not amount to a majority stake,
according to Simon Rothman, head of eBay's Automotive division.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies will share the site's revenue, which will come
primarily from fees: $25 for each vehicle listed and another $25
for each successful sale. EBay will run the site and provide
customer service, while AutoTrader.com will help car dealers use
the site.
</P>
<P>
   AutoTrader.com's free classified ad service, its main way of
selling cars, is used by 40,000 dealers and 250,000 private sellers
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of AutoTrader.com is held by Manheim Auctions, a
longtime player in the wholesale car auction industry. Another
investor is Automatic Data Processing, a company that provides back
office support for car dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its online used car sales, AutoTrader.com is the
exclusive Web distributor of Auto Trader and AutoMart magazines.
</P>
<P>
   EBay began offering vehicle auctions a year ago, when it noticed
that members were selling cars in the Web site's ``Miscellaneous''
category. Since then, Automotive has been one of eBay's fastest
growing areas, both in number of participants and money spent, said
Rothman, who said eBay doesn't release specific figures about sales
in different categories.
</P>
<P>
   While more than a quarter of used car buyers do research on the
Internet, less than 2 percent of them actually find a car they want
to buy online, according to a recent J.D. Powers report. Within
that 2 percent, the group of customers who are willing to
participate in an online auction is even slimmer.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clara's AutoWeb.com and Autobytel.com, an online car
seller based in Irvine, operate mostly by referring car buyers to
local dealers. Both companies offer auctions which represent a
minor portion of their overall sales, according to company
spokesmen.
</P>
<P>
   AutoWeb.com lets dealers, but not consumers, auction used cars.
Jim Wolfe, the company's vice president in charge of marketing,
said that AutoWeb may offer consumer-to-consumer auctions one day,
but he feels that car buyers aren't ready for it yet.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Delligatta, chief operating officer of Autobytel.com, agreed
that consumer-to-consumer auctions are an alternative that the
average consumer isn't ready to use. Autobytel.com debuted used car
auctions last fall, and has 4,000 used cars up for auction, both by
consumers and dealers.
