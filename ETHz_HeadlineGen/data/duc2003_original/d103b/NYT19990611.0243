   When a company's Internet site breaks down, it usually means a
minor annoyance for consumers and a costly embarassment to the Web
site owners. But when eBay, the world's largest Internet auction
service, was knocked out of service late Thursday, the breakdown
put Tom Ostrowski of Cincinnati temporarily out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure as hell need to make a lot of money right now, and it's
killing me,'' says Ostrowski, who made $6,000 last month selling
used books and old magazines on eBay. ``All my eggs are in the eBay
basket,''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of eBay entrepreneurs like Ostrowski are fuming over
the outage, which was caused by a faulty database server computer.
Friday night, eBay was still out of commission. So were angry eBay
dealers, who say they'll start peddling their merchandise at other
on-line auction sites.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Fulton, a Fredericksburg, Va. dealer in Civil War
memorabilia, said he will start listing 40 percent of his
merchandise on an auction site run by the popular Internet portal
Yahoo. As for eBay, ``I think we are very nearly through with
counting on them to provide a major source of our income,'' Fulton
said.
</P>
<P>
   eBay's success at attracting merchants like Fulton is one of the
keys to its success. Since it debuted in 1995, the company has
grown to host 1.8 million auctions at any given time, with over
250,000 new items posted on a typical day. The sheer number of
items available on eBay attracts millions of potential buyers, who
in turn attract still more sellers. eBay makes its profit by taking
commissions and listing fees on every sale.
</P>
<P>
   But eBay has a history of spotty reliability. The Thursday
outage follows a similar incident on Wednesday. Before that, eBay
suffered a major breakdown in May and briefer outages last December
in the midst of the Christmas shopping season.
</P>
<P>
   Many other Internet firms have suffered outages. The America
Online computer network was knocked off-line for 19 hours in August
of 1996. Then in December, the company's new flat-rate pricing
scheme boosted usage levels to the point where many subscribers
couldn't get through at any price. AOL ended up paying refunds to
angry customers and spending $100 million to upgrade the system.
More recently, major Internet on-line trading firms like ETrade
have been socked by serious technical problems.
</P>
<P>
   But the breakdown could be especially painful for eBay, due to
its unusual blend of commerce and populism. The company has
fostered an on-line community where buyers and sellers spend hours
discussing their lives as well as their latest bargains. According
to statistics from Media Metrix Inc., eBay's seven million monthly
users spend an average of two hours at the site, compared to just a
few minutes a month at most other sites.
</P>
<P>
   Fiona Swerdlow, senior analyst at Jupiter Communications LLC in
New York, warns that this kind of loyalty won't survive frequent
service outages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say eBay's number-one priority at this point is to get
their arms around this problem,'' Swerdlow said.
</P>
<P>
   eBay spokesman Kevin Pursglove (cq) expressed embarrassment and
concern over his firm's recent stumbles. ``In our first two or
three years we were up and running, we were always proud of the
fact that we were up 98, 99 percent of the time,'' Pursglove said.
``Something has changed here.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, eBay dealers are sizing up their options. Marsha
Collier of Los Angeles, a long-time eBay user who has just written
a book on Internet auctions, refuses to panic. ``When we're dealing
with computers, for gosh sakes, they're going to go down,'' Collier
said. ``Things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she's taking steps to avoid losing money on her auctions
of Beanie Babies and Star Trek action figures. Auctions last for
one week, and Collier said that the loss of a day's bidding will
depress prices to an artificially low level. That's why she's
sending e-mails to everybody who bid on an item before the system
crashed to tell them that the auction is cancelled.
</P>
<P>
   Collier said she'll restart her auctions once eBay is up and
running again. But she pointed out that because many eBay users
probably won't cancel their auctions, smart eBay buyers should go
looking for good deals as soon as the site reopens. ``There's going
to be some great bargains on eBay,'' Collier said.
