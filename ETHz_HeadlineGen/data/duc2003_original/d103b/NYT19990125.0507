At least two law enforcement agencies are investigating alleged
fraud on eBay and other Internet auction sites after consumers
complained that they had been cheated.
</P>
<P>
   New York City consumer authorities confirmed yesterday that they
are ``actively investigating complaints regarding alleged
fraudulent sales'' at online auctioneers.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Post reported that city officials are looking into
sales of sports memorabilia on eBay in which supposedly
one-of-a-kind items were sold to more than one person. City
officials are said to be holding eBay responsible because it
collects commissions on sales.
</P>
<P>
   EBay's position has been that it is an innocent middleman.
Although it may assist consumers who believe that they have been
fraud victims, the San Jose company urges them to work with law
enforcement agencies. Yesterday, eBay issued a statement saying it
will ``offer to fully cooperate with any investigation involving
improper items on the site.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has hosted some 43 million auctions since it
was founded in 1995, recently added new safety tools to protect
customers.
</P>
<P>
   In Pennsylvania, the state attorney general's office said
consumers in 20 states will be reimbursed for Furbys they bought on
eBay from a seller who is accused of not delivering the popular
toys.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Jamison T. Piatt of Mocanaqua, Pa.,
advertised the sale of nearly 500 Furbys at $60 apiece, which he
promised to deliver in time for Christmas. He accepted payments
from dozens of bidders but delivered less than 10 Furbys, according
to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ripped people off from New York to California,'' said
Barbara Petito of the Pennsylvania attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of a settlement, Piatt will pay more &UR;  &LR; than $2,600 in
restitution to 29 customers, deliver two Furbys to one customer and
pay $1,000 for civil penalties and investigation costs. Piatt, who
also was known as George Williams or George Lijerus, also agreed to
pay additional restitution on all legitimate complaints against him
filed within 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania authorities said they are investigating other cases
of alleged fraud on eBay, and they expect to file additional
complaints. The enforcement action against Piatt was their first
involving illegal Internet trade.
</P>
<P>
   The actions come a little more than a week after eBay, the
nation's most popular online auction site, tightened its security
and stiffened penalties for fraud. The company, which hosts
auctions selling everything from baseball cards to Beanie Babies,
in March plans to start a user-identification program allowing
consumers to register their driver's license, Social Security
number and date of birth for $5. The program is designed to let
eBay users identify fellow traders.
</P>
<P>
   EBay also will provide free insurance through Lloyd's of London
for transactions valued at $25 to $200.
</P>
<P>
   According to eBay, fraud occurs only in about 27 of every 1
million transactions.
</P>
<P>
   There are many ways consumers can be cheated. Besides paying for
goods never delivered or receiving goods that don't match product
descriptions, auction users have complained of such practices as
``shill bidding,'' in which sellers bid on their own merchandise to
drive up prices.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Dodd, founder of AuctionWatch, a Web site where auction
users post messages and complaints, said auction sites are ripe for
fraud because it is so easy to be anonymous on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for you to get a new driver's license and become a
new person,'' he said. ``On the Web, all you have to do is go to
hotmail.com (or other sites providing free e-mail) set up a new
e-mail account and you're a new person.''
