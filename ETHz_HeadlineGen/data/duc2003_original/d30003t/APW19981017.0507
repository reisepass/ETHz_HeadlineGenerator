	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet has
been arrested by British police on a Spanish extradition warrant,
despite protests from Chile that he is entitled to diplomatic
immunity.
	   Two Spanish judges are seeking to question Pinochet about the

Sept. 11, 1973, the date he seized power, and Dec. 31, 1983. No
reason for the dates was given.
