	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Snoopy, perched on his doghouse in front of his
typewriter, looks over a farewell message from creator Charles Schulz in the
last new daily ``Peanuts'' strip, running in newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Schulz, 77, who has written, drawn, colored and lettered every ``Peanuts''
strip for almost 50 years, decided to retire after being diagnosed with colon
cancer in November. His contract stipulates that no one else will ever draw the
comic strip.
</P>
<P>
	   The single-panel farewell strip is primarily a text message, over Schulz's
signature, with the Snoopy drawing in the lower right corner.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Dear Friends,'' Schulz writes. ``I have been fortunate to draw Charlie
Brown and his friends for almost 50 years. It has been the fulfillment of my
childhood ambition. Unfortunately, I am no longer able to maintain the schedule
demanded by a daily comic strip, therefore I am announcing my retirement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have been grateful over the years for the loyalty of our editors and the
wonderful support and love expressed to me by fans of the comic strip.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus, Lucy ... how can I ever forget them...''
</P>
<P>
	   Schulz's beloved cast of characters appear in 2,600 newspapers, reaching an
estimated 355 million readers daily in 75 countries.
</P>
<P>
	   A final new Sunday strip by Schulz will run in newspapers on Feb. 13. After
that, United Feature Syndicate will publish ``Peanuts'' reprints.
</P>
<P>
	   Schulz, who is focusing on his health and family at home in Santa Rosa,
Calif., never expected the support he's be given by readers, who have sent him
400 to 500 pieces of mail a day, his secretary, Edna Poehner, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He just drew pictures. It's overwhelming for him,'' she said.
