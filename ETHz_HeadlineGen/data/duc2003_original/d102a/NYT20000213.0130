   Charles Schulz, the creator of ``Peanuts,'' the tender and sage
comic strip starring Charlie Brown and Snoopy that was read by 355
million people around the world, died in his sleep on Saturday
night at his home in Santa Rosa, Calif., just hours before his last
cartoon ran in the Sunday newspapers. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was colon cancer, said Paige Braddock,
creative director of Charles M. Schulz Creative Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz drew ``Peanuts'' for nearly half a century. He swore that
no one else would ever draw the comic strip and he kept his word.
He finally put down his pen when he received a diagnosis of colon
cancer after abdominal surgery in November.
</P>
<P>
   His last daily strip ran on Jan. 3. His last Sunday strip
carried a signed farewell in which he said, ``Charlie Brown,
Snoopy, Linus, Lucy ... how can I ever forget them. ...''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Jeannie, said, ``He had done everything he wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Peanuts,'' which reached readers in 75 countries, 2,600 papers
and 21 languages every day, made Schulz very rich. The ``Peanuts''
strips, merchandise and product endorsements brought in $1.1
billion a year. And Schulz was said to have earned about $30
million to $40 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   Jules Feiffer, the cartoonist and playwright, said that the
``Peanuts'' characters endure because they were the first real
children in the comics pages, ones with doubts and anxieties. And
there were a lot of them. ``Linus, Lucy, Charlie Brown _ these
interesting little people formed a repertory company,'' Feiffer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Monroe Schulz, the son of a barber, like Charlie Brown's
father, was born in Minnesota on Nov. 26, 1922. He wanted to be a
cartoonist as a child and practiced by drawing Popeye. ``Someday,
Charles, you're going to be an artist,'' a kindergarten teacher
told him after looking at his drawing of a man shoveling snow.
</P>
<P>
   The hurts of Schulz's early years provided a lifetime of
material. At Central High School in St. Paul's, Minn., he flunked
Latin, English, algebra and physics. ``Ripley's Believe It or
Not!'' accepted one of his drawings when he was 15 but the cartoons
he drew for his high school yearbook were rejected.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation he took a correspondence course from Art
Instruction Inc., but before he could start a career he was drafted
into the Army. He left for boot camp only days after his mother
died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   After serving in France and Germany during World War II, Schulz
tried various odd jobs: lettering the comics at a Catholic magazine
called Timeless Topix; drawing a weekly cartoon called ``Li'l
Folks,'' the precursor to ``Peanuts,'' for the St. Paul Pioneer
Press; and selling occasional spot cartoons to The Saturday Evening
Post.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, Schulz married Joyce Halverson; the couple had five
children. The marriage ended in divorce in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1949, Schulz submitted some of his ``Li'l Folks'' comic
strips to United Feature Syndicate. The syndicate liked the strip
but insisted on calling it ``Peanuts,'' because ``Li'l Folks'' was
too similar to another strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very upset with the title,'' Schulz once said, ``and
still am.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 2, 1950, the first ``Peanuts'' strip was published.
Seven newspapers bought ``Peanuts'' that year, and Schulz earned
$90 a week in royalties. But by 1953, the cartoon was a hit and he
was earning $30,000 per year. In 1955 (and again in 1964) the
National Cartoonists Society awarded Schulz the Reuben for being
the outstanding cartoonist of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The strips were just the beginning. In 1952, Schulz started
turning out ``Peanuts'' books, and new compilations rolled off the
presses every year for decades. Eventually ``Peanuts'' was
translated into Serbo-Croatian, Malay, Chinese, Tlingit, Catalan
and 15 other languages.
</P>
<P>
   The 1960s brought animated ``Peanuts'' television specials. The
first was ``A Charlie Brown Christmas,'' which shown on CBS in 1965
and won an Emmy and a Peabody. Many more television specials
followed, five of which won Emmys, and there were also ``Peanuts''
feature films, including ``A Boy Named Charlie Brown.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The takeoffs came rolling in. In 1966, the Royal Guardsmen wrote
a rock song, ``Snoopy and the Red Baron.'' In 1967, a musical,
``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown,'' was produced Off-Broadway. (A
1999 revival on Broadway won two Tony Awards.) ``Peanuts Gallery,''
a concerto, was composed by Ellen Taaffe Zwilich and had its
premiere at Carnegie Hall in 1997. Schulz received the Ordre des
Arts et des Lettres from the French Ministry of Culture. In 1990,
his work was shown at the Louvre; the gala had Snoopys in couture.
</P>
<P>
   Many pundits tried to put their finger on the ``Peanuts'' spell
and they generally rambled on in a vaguely philosophical vein.
</P>
<P>
   Robert L. Short, a minister, wrote two books on Peanuts
theology, ``The Gospel According to Peanuts,'' (1964) and ``The
Parables of Peanuts''(1969). He saw signs of original sin in the
``Peanuts'' children, who were unable ``to produce any radical
change for the better in themselves _ or in each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The licensing madness began in 1958, when the first plastic
Snoopy and Charlie Brown came out. In 1960, Hallmark began printing
``Peanuts'' cards and party goods. Then came sweat shirts and
pajamas, thermoses and lunchboxes. Plush Snoopy came in 1965.
Woodstock slippers, Lucy picture frames, Charlie Brown music boxes
followed.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz vetted all products for appropriateness and turned some
down; baby wipes (for aesthetic reasons), ashtrays, vitamins,
sugary breakfast cereals, ice-skates and tennis rackets.
</P>
<P>
   There were commercials too. In 1957 the ``Peanuts'' characters
started selling Ford Falcons. For 15 years they worked for the
Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. Snoopy was the official NASA
mascot, and in 1969 NASA's lunar excursion module on the Apollo 11
mission was called Snoopy. The command module was Charlie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   By 1999, there were 20,000 different new products each year
adorned by ``Peanuts'' characters. In 1994, Schulz was inducted
into the Licensing Industry Merchandisers' Association Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he minded his characters selling stuff,
Schulz said, ``I don't think there's such a thing as going
commercial with a comic strip, because a comic strip is a
commercial right from the beginning.'' It is there to sell
newspapers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Forbes listed the cartoonist among the 10 wealthiest
entertainers, earning $32 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless his lifestyle remained simple. Schulz, who hated to
travel, said he would have been happy living his whole life in
Minneapolis. But ``had a restless first wife,'' so they moved to
Sebastopol, Calif., and he set up his studio in Santa Rosa.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, a year after his divorce, Schulz met Jeannie Clyde and
married her.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Church of God, a church that tithes, Schulz was
a religious man. He was a Sunday-school teacher and administrator
and would occasionally deliver the Sunday sermon. He did not drink
or smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his large family and success, Schulz was a melancholy
man who worried and was often lonely, depressed and plagued by
panic attacks, features that Rheta Grimsley Johnson brought out in
her 1989 biography ``Good Grief: The Story of Charles M. Schulz.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't create humor out of happiness,'' Schulz said is his
1980 book, ``Charlie Brown, Snoopy and Me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm astonished at the number of people who write to me saying,
`Why can't you create happy stories for us? Why does Charlie Brown
always have to lose? Why can't you let him kick the football?'
Well, there is nothing funny about the person who gets to kick the
football.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulz is survived by his wife, Jeannie, a philanthropist, and
his children: Meredith Hodges, of Loveland, Colo.; Charles, Jr.
(called Monte), of Nevada City, Calif.; Craig, of Santa Rosa,
Calif.; Amy Johnson, of Alpine, Utah; and Jill Schulz Transki, of
Santa Barbara, Calif.; two stepchildren, Brooke Clyde, of Santa
Rosa; and Lisa Brockway, of Ashland, Ore.; and 18 grandchildren.
