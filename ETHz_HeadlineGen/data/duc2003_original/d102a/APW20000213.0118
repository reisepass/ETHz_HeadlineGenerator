	   The coincidence of Charles Schulz's death one day before his final
``Peanuts'' appeared in newspapers weighed heavily Sunday on fans of Charlie
Brown, Snoopy and Lucy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's real sad. He did a really neat strip and it really touched a lot of
people's lives. It's really too bad he couldn't enjoy his retirement,'' said
Charles Weier, who lives in the house in St. Paul, Minn., where Schulz spent his
teen-age years.
</P>
<P>
	   Schulz was diagnosed with colon cancer and suffered a series of small
strokes during emergency surgery in November 1999, and announced his retirement
a few weeks afterward.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the last appearance of a new ``Peanuts'' strip, Sunday was
officially Charles ``Sparky'' Schulz Day in St. Paul.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will all miss his daily dose of wisdom,'' St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman
said Saturday when he proclaimed the observance, before Schulz's death. ``In
each of his characters, we see a little bit of ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
	   About 250 people ignored snow and temperatures in the teens Saturday as
Coleman unveiled an ice sculpture of the Peanuts characters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's just ironic that in your last comic strip you're gonna call it all
and ... all of a sudden you die,'' said Rick Micheltree, a cook at Mickey's
Diner in St. Paul.
</P>
<P>
	   At the International Museum of Cartoon Art in Boca Raton, Fla., a red rose
was placed beneath a portrait of Schulz with Snoopy atop a snow-covered doghouse
in the background. Larry Brokahn, 39, of Boca Raton left yellow and purple
daisies at the foot of a Charlie Brown statue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've read Peanuts since I was 12,'' Brokahn said.
</P>
<P>
	   Schulz's first feature, ``Li'l Folks,'' was developed for the Saint Paul
Pioneer Press in 1947. In 1950, it was sold to a syndicate and the name changed
to ``Peanuts.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nobody thought he was too good, to tell you the truth, because he had a
whole different style,'' Mort Walker, creator of ``Beetle Bailey,'' said Sunday
from Boca Raton, Fla., in an interview with WCCO-TV in Minneapolis. ``He didn't
do the traditional solid cartoon, which was kind of slapstick humor. But he
brought in pathos, failure, rejection, all that stuff and somehow made it
funny.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's sad to think that he didn't get the chance to see his last strip
running in the paper,'' Tom Batiuk, cartoonist of ``Funky Winkerbean'' and
``Crankshaft,'' said Sunday from his home in Medina, Ohio. ``It would have been
nice to see him bask in the glory of it a little bit more.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am part of that generation of cartoonists that were just devoted to his
work,'' Batiuk added. ``Strips prior to his time reflected the world around us,
he opened a door to the world inside us and allowed us to share feelings that
are common to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mell Lazarus, who draws the ``Momma'' and ``Miss Peach'' strips, knew Schulz
for 42 years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think 'Peanuts' has been for most of its existence the best comic strip
in history, and nothing's ever approached it,'' Lazarus said. ``He's going to be
missed and will clearly never be replaced.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``For 50 years, his keen eye, his good and generous heart, and his active
brush and pen have given life to the most memorable cast of characters ever to
enliven our daily papers,'' President Clinton said in a statement Sunday. ``The
hopeful and hapless Charlie Brown, the joyful Snoopy, the soulful Linus -- even
the 'crabby' Lucy -- give voice, day after day, to what makes us human.''
</P>
<P>
	   Charlie Brown was the favorite ``Peanuts'' character for Don Tansey, 50, of
Short Hills, N.J., because it was so easy for people to relate to him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The guy's always trying to do the best for others, and he gets left
behind. It's a theme that happens so much in this country. The nice people get
left behind,'' Tansey said.
