   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Cartoonist Charles Schulz has finally found
a home for Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus and Lucy.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Rosa's most famous resident, who began drawing his
``Peanuts'' strip in 1950, is building a 17,000-square-foot museum
as a repository for his half-century of work _ a career interrupted
by only a five-week vacation two years ago to celebrate his 75th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The two-story museum, replete with several galleries to display
Schulz's mind-boggling body of work and an 11,600-square-foot
courtyard, will be built in Santa Rosa across the street from the
Redwood Empire Ice Arena that Schulz built in 1969. There was no
cost estimate available for the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled they're going to build it,'' Santa Rosa Mayor
Janet Condron said Tuesday, just before she and the rest of the
City Council enthusiastically and unanimously endorsed a rezoning
that will clear the way for construction to begin on the 1.6-acre
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of artifacts and art will be on display. It will be a
real tourist attraction,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While almost any rezoning or construction project usually
involves some level of public opposition, particularly when four
heritage oak trees are scheduled to be axed as is scheduled as part
of Schulz's project, there were no dissenting voices present to
oppose the city's most celebrated resident.
</P>
<P>
   Even Jack Osborne, a council watcher who routinely voices a
dissenting view on issues before the council at least half a dozen
times per meeting, was in support. ``How can anyone oppose Charlie
Schulz?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 77-year-old cartoonist is expected to apply for a building
permit within a month, with construction targeted to begin next
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Once built, the two-story building will house an array of
galleries to display Schulz's work, a 99-seat theater, an
educational and research center along with offices. But mostly it
will provide plenty of room to display Schulz's work and
memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   The strip, which began appearing in seven papers including the
San Francisco Chronicle and the Chicago Tribune on Oct. 2, 1950,
now appears in 2,600 newspapers in 75 countries.
</P>
<P>
   It has spawned much more than a daily comic strip. The
``Peanuts'' characters have been the subject of plays, books,
recordings and TV movies. Along the way, Schulz has won five Emmys,
two Peabody Awards and the French Order of Arts and Letters.
