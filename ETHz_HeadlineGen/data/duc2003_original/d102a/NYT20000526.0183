   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Comics pages in newspapers around the world
will be pretty much all-Peanuts on Saturday as a tribute to 50
years of humor and insight from the late Charles Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow cartoonists had hoped to surprise Schulz with the salute,
which they set in motion before he became ill in November. He was
77 when he died of cancer at his home in Santa Rosa in February.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the National Cartoonists Society decided after
Schulz's death to continue with their plans and to honor him
posthumously by including allusions to him and his globally beloved
Peanuts characters in May 27 strips.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unprecedented, nothing that has ever been attempted
before,'' said illustrator Rick Stromoski of Connecticut, an
officer in the cartoonists group.
</P>
<P>
   Stromoski said about 95 percent of all syndicated cartoons, on
newspaper comics pages and the editorial pages, will feature
drawings of, or references to, Schulz and members of Charlie
Brown's gang.
</P>
<P>
   Garfield checks out what it's like to sleep on the roof of a
doghouse. Cathy imagines the perfect man to possess the combined
virtues of the Peanuts gang. Hagar the Horrible sports a Charlie
Brown zigzag shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz's colleagues chose Saturday as the day to honor 50 years
of Peanuts because the National Cartoonists Society is meeting that
day in New York City for its annual conference and awards ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, before Schulz was diagnosed in November with
metastasized colon cancer, was that Schulz would attend the
conference and would open his Saturday newspaper to find nearly all
of the cartoons dedicated to him and his half-century career. Then,
on Saturday night, his peers had planned to present Schulz with a
lifetime achievement award.
</P>
<P>
   Although Schulz did not live to meet again with his peers and
spend a weekend talking about his favorite subject _ cartooning _
the cartoons honoring him will appear in newspapers as planned, and
on Saturday night in New York the society will present a lifetime
achievement award to his widow, Jeannie.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz's syndicated comic strip debuted in seven newspapers Oct.
2, 1950. Peanuts became the most popular strip in history,
translated into more than 20 languages and published in 2,600
newspapers around the world. The United Feature Syndicate is now
distributing reruns of Peanuts strips.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz, a native of Minnesota, moved to California in 1958. He
was working at his studio in Santa Rosa Nov. 16 when he told
employees he had pain in his legs and he wasn't feeling well.
</P>
<P>
   Following emergency surgery on a blockage in his abdominal
aorta, he disclosed he had been diagnosed with colon cancer. He
died in his sleep at home Feb. 12.
