   HOLLYWOOD _ You're on your own, Charlie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   After drawing more than 18,000 comic strips over a half-century
about a pie-faced little loser who never got any smarter or any
older, a boy whose best friends were grief and unease, who was
regularly outsmarted by his own dog, Charles Schulz has decided to
put down his pen and cut Charlie Brown some slack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always wanted to be a cartoonist and I feel very
blessed to have been able to do what I love for almost 50 years,''
Schulz said in an open letter that was released Tuesday from his
home in Santa Rosa, Calif. ``That all of you have embraced Snoopy,
Charlie Brown, Lucy and Linus and all the other `Peanuts'
characters has been a constant motivation for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulz, 77, said that he would stop drawing the strip
immediately and that it would retire when the last one runs on Jan.
4. The cartoonist was recently found to have colon cancer and said
he needed to devote himself to fighting his illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peanuts'' has appeared, without interruption, since it was
introduced on Oct. 2, 1950. Schulz has drawn every one of the
strips, taking time off only for his 70th birthday, though he
worked ahead so that the strip would continue to appear while he
was off, said Diane Iselin, a spokeswoman for United Media, which
syndicated the strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peanuts'' appears in 2,600 newspapers in 75 countries and 21
languages, making it the most popular comic strip in the world, Ms.
Iselin said.
</P>
<P>
   A social and marketing phenomenon that grew beyond the funny
pages to become one of the cornerstones of postwar popular culture,
``Peanuts'' followed the angst-ridden exploits of a group of
children in a nameless American suburb _hapless Charlie Brown, his
conniving dog Snoopy, the sharp-tongued Lucy, her blanket-cuddling
brother Linus, the Beethoven-adoring Schroeder, forever-sandalled
Peppermint Patty and Woodstock and all the others. Adults never
appeared in the strip.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz, the son of a barber in St. Paul, Minn., went by the
nickname of Sparky (for a character in the ``Barney Google'' comic
strip), though he has described himself as shy and removed. As a
youth, he took a correspondence course in cartooning and earned a
C-plus in ``Drawing of Children,'' according to the official
biography on the comic strip's official Web page.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems beyond comprehension of people that someone can be
born to draw comic strips,'' Schulz says in his official biography.
``But I think I was. My ambition from earliest memory was to
produce a daily comic strip.''
</P>
<P>
   After serving in the military in World War II, Schulz began to
draw a comic strip for a local Roman Catholic newspaper and later
joined the faculty of the same correspondence school that he had
once studied with. One of his earliest characters was Charlie
Brown. After selling several single-panel comics to The Saturday
Evening Post, he began a weekly single-panel comic in The St. Paul
Pioneer Press called ``L'il Folks,'' which starred Charlie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   When an editor at the Universal Feature Syndicate suggested to
Schulz that he expand to a strip format, the cartoonist signed a
five-year contract. But legal tangles forced Schulz to change the
name of his strip from ``L'il Folks'' (too close to ``L'il Abner'')
to ``Peanuts,'' a name he hated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peanuts'' took several years to catch on in the crowded comic
strip market. But by 1952, it was popular enough that Rinehart and
Co. decided to take the unusual step of issuing a selection of the
strips in a mass-market paperback.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, a San Francisco housewife asked Schulz if she could
create a ``Peanuts'' calendar, the beginning of more than three
decades of ``Peanuts'' marketing that has expanded to plush toys,
games, books, stickers, videocasettes and hundreds of other items _
and will continue even as the strip ends.
</P>
<P>
   There was a ``Peanuts'' musical on Broadway, several television
specials (including the Emmy-winning ``Charlie Brown Christmas'' in
1965) and a hit 1966 recording (``Snoopy vs. the Red Baron'' by the
Royal Guardsmen) that turned Charlie Brown's dog, deluded into
thinking he was a World War I flying ace, into the strip's most
popular and ubiquitous character.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad, sad time for us,'' Lorrie Myers, Schulz'
secretary, told The Associated Press. ``It has been such a part of
our lives for 50 years. We've kind of grown up on Snoopy and
Charlie Brown and to see it come to a close is a sad time.''
