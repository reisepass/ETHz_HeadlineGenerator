   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A self-portrait of Charles Schulz hangs
above a doorway at the International Museum of Cartoon Art in Boca
Raton. It's strange to see an adult drawn by Schulz _ shock of
white hair, soft smile, bright eyes, clearly a grown-up.
</P>
<P>
   We have known his diminutive creations for almost a
half-century, but we have not known the artist. He has been the
invisible man who touched millions of lives with his gang of kids,
a dog and a bird.
</P>
<P>
   The portrait looks down upon a 50-years-of-``Peanuts'' exhibit,
Oct. 2, 1950, to Oct. 2, 2000. Below it is a computation of how
many ``Peanuts'' strips Schulz will have drawn by Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
   18,236.
</P>
<P>
   We'll have to settle for around 18,000.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the ``Peanuts'' gang retires after almost _ but not quite
_ 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Linus, Lucy, Charlie Brown. They were just kids 50 years ago,
maybe age 8 or 10 or thereabouts. Now they're retiring. At age 8 or
10 or thereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   And that dog. He's about 350 in dog years, and still waiting for
a bowl of something other than dog food. Still waiting for a clean
shot at the Red Baron. Today Snoopy, the Walter Mitty of dogdom,
puts his Sopwith Camel into mothballs.
</P>
<P>
   And his fine feathered friend. Today, Woodstock flies off to
wherever 30-year-old birds fly off to.
</P>
<P>
   WE WISH HIM WELL
</P>
<P>
   Game's over. Charlie Brown's hapless baseball team leaves the
field. Lucy kicks the football into a closet. The kite is treed for
good.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Great Pumpkin looks for another magic patch.
</P>
<P>
   And so do we.
</P>
<P>
   Charles M. Schulz, 78, has capped his ink bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz, we hope, will beat the colon cancer that forced his
retirement, will get to Oct. 2 and many years beyond. We wish him
well because we feel we know him. We know we like him. And we love
his creations.
</P>
<P>
   But we're greedy, aren't we? We want him back, and he hasn't
even left. We're like Linus on the morning after Halloween when,
once again, there's been no visit by the Great Pumpkin: a little
bit alone, a little bit sad, but ever faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that security blanket Linus tugged around all these
decades was Schulz's inside joke on us. His comic strip became our
blanket, always there when we wanted it. Small, plain, homespun,
but full of redemptive power.
</P>
<P>
   That was ``Peanuts.'' Big gift in a small package. Irony without
cynicism. Wisdom without preaching. Humor as expressive and
graceful as those bars of Beethoven that Schroeder pounded out on
his miniature grand piano.
</P>
<P>
   STORYTELLING WITH A LESSON
</P>
<P>
   No adult ever appeared in the strip, yet this was anything but a
strip just for kids. Schulz wound a double helix of humor around
the ``Peanuts'' gang: Slapstick stunts kids loved entwined with
nuanced jabs at adult pretensions that adults loved. A single
strip, a single quizzical look on Charlie Brown's face, could carry
two distinct jokes, two lessons, two stories. That's the genius of
Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   Give a kid and an adult a ``Pogo'' strip and the adult might
laugh. The kid will be totally confused. Walt Kelly, Pogo's
creator, was the Faulkner of the cartoon genre. Give a kid and an
adult a ``Daffy Duck'' strip and the kid might laugh. The adult
will furrow a brow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doonesbury''? baby boomer laughs; grandparent does not.
``Beetle Bailey''? Old G.I. laughs; Baby Boomer looks for
``Doonesbury.'' Al Capp? A genius, but you won't find your 8-year
old rolling on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   But give anyone a ``Peanuts'' strip, and they'll find something
to smile about. Nobody grabbed everybody like Schulz. Maybe that's
why so many millions of readers turned to ``Peanuts'' before they
read the day's dose of bad news. And why so many millions more
turned to ``Peanuts'' as a balm after reading the day's bad news.
There's nothing like Snoopy beholding a sunset to remind you, if
only for a moment, of life's bounty.
</P>
<P>
   Or take Sally, the girl who cannot fathom school, who
reincarnates our childhood fears of teachers. Or Woodstock, named
in 1970 for the rock concert, who became Schulz's metaphor for an
entire generation: awe-inspired, curious, tentative in spite of its
rhetoric. Pig Pen was the iconoclast, the rebel in Schulz. Linus is
trust personified, but with a security blanket. Just in case.
</P>
<P>
   THE GANG'S ALL SCHULZ
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to forget that this gang is the emotional expression
of a single artist. The ``Peanuts'' gang is Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   He said once that Lucy's cynicism was his way of dealing with
his own.
</P>
<P>
   And Snoopy harbors Schulz's desire for adventure _ Schulz grew
up reading ``Steve Canyon'' _ and Snoopy takes flight where Canyon
left off.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Brown a loser? Too easy. Charlie Brown is the common
man, the everyman. He is Schulz's vehicle for coming to terms with
the three years he spent in the Army during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``World War II taught me all I needed to know about
loneliness,'' Schulz said in a memoir. ``And my sympathy for the
loneliness all of us experience has dropped heavily upon poor
Charlie Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulz gave us a window on his soul, as great artists do. And he
gave us a window on our world, on ourselves, as the greatest
artists do.
</P>
<P>
   He once said that he hoped only to add something to the cartoon
profession he loved. Boy, did he ever.
</P>
<P>
   His gang of shorties taught us how to lose with grace. They
taught us how to dream, share, discern. Snoopy challenged the Red
Baron and the cat next door. Lucy challenged everybody. Sally
challenged the establishment. Linus challenged faith.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Brown challenged life.
</P>
<P>
   And Charles Schulz challenged us.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the strip is going into syndication. Reruns. It won't be
the same, will it? There's something very un-``Peanuts'' about
syndication. We'll be seeing ghosts, looking back. No matter how
often his kite crashed, no matter how often his team lost, Charlie
Brown never looked back, only up and onward.
</P>
<P>
   No more.
