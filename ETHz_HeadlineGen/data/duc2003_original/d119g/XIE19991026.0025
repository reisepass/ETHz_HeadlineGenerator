DHAKA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Monday received fresh
assurance from India of reaching a solution to border problems by
February or March next year, according to the official Bangladesh
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The assurance came from Indian Border Security Force (BSF)
Chief Ram Mohan following talks between Bangladesh Rifles (BDR)
and BSF at the BDR headquarters here Monday.
</P>
<P>
As there is a stable government in India now, India is
optimistic to reach a solution on border issues by February to
March of the next year, the BSF chief said at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not explain whether it would be solved through
ratification of the 1974 treaty by the Indian side or by any other
means.
</P>
<P>
Initiating the two-day conference, BDR Director General Major
General Azizur Rahman described the absence of ratification of the
1974 treaty by India as the root cause of all disputes and
conflicts along the 4,310-kilometer-long border between Bangladesh
and India.

<P>
He regretted recent incidents in some parts of the border areas
which resulted in a series of clashes, killing and kidnaps.

<P>
Meanwhile, a BDR press release said the border coordination
conference at the Director General level began with a cordial
atmosphere here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The BSF and BDR agreed in the talks to extend cooperation in
taking effective measures to stop smuggling and other border
crimes. The conference will end on October 28.
