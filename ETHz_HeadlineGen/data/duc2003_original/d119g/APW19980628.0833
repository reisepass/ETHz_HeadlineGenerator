	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ India's foreign secretary flew to
Bangladesh on Sunday for high-level talks, less than two weeks
after Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina visited India to
urge restraint following its nuclear tests in May.
	   ``The visit is to carry on and renew our friendly contacts with
Bangladesh,'' K. Raghunath told reporters after landing at the
Dhaka airport.
	   Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina met with her Indian counterpart
Atal Bihari Vajpayee in New Delhi June 16. She was the first head
of state to visit India after its nuclear tests, which were later
matched by Islamabad.
	   Raghunath, a former Indian ambassador to Bangladesh, said his
visit ``will give an opportunity to review and update the excellent
relationship between the two countries.''
	   Raghunath was scheduled to meet Hasina before the official talks
Monday.
	   Bangladesh Foreign Secretary Mustafizur Rahman said the two
sides were looking forward to successful discussions.
	   The Bangladesh-India agenda is topped by a dispute over sharing
of the Ganges River water.
	   For years, Bangladesh has protested what it calls inadequate
supply of water from the Ganges River each summer. India says it
needs the water to keep the Calcutta port navigable for ships.
	   The two countries are also expected to discuss the issue of
Bangladeshi refugees living in India.
	   Vajpayee's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which came
to power in February-March elections, had campaigned to send back
the refugees, many of whom never returned after they fled their
country during its 1971 war of independence from Pakistan.
	   Both nations also have plans to cooperate in combating
separatist violence in their nations. Rebels from both countries
have often fled to the other across the dense forests or rice paddy
fields at the border.
	   Indian rebel leader Anup Chetia is currently awaiting trial in
Bangladesh on charges of entering the country illegally. The trial
puts on hold India's request that Chetia be extradited to face
murder and kidnapping charges.
