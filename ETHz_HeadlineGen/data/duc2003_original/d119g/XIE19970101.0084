DHAKA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- India and Bangladesh today
formally started sharing the common Ganges water after India
opened 75 sluice-gates of its Farakka barrage at 06:30 a.m. local
time (0030 GMT) in implementation of an agreement between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
India and Bangladesh signed a 30-year water-sharing treaty on
December 12, 1996, to resolve their long-standing dispute over the
matter.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh had accused India of withdrawing the Ganges water at
the upper stream, thus greatly reducing the water flowing into
Bangladesh during the dry season beginning in January.
</P>
<P>
According to sources, the release of the Ganges water through
the Farakka will enable Bangladesh to irrigate vast tracts of
land, increase underground water level, check desertification and
ease salinity in coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
To monitor the flow of water, Indian experts have been staying
at the Farakka point since December 25 while Bangladeshi water
experts are expected to arrive there at noon today.
