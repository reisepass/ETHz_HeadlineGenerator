DHAKA, July 17 (Xinhua -- Bangladesh and India Monday kicked
off border talks in Chittagong, the largest port city in the
country, in the wake of a series of bloody border clashes which
left five people dead in both sides during the last week.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources told Xinhua that the two sides had two rounds
of talks on the first day of a three-day high-level border
conference between the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) and the Indian
Border Security Force (BSF).
</P>
<P>
Officials of the BDR, the border guard of Bangladesh, said the
talks were going on smoothly.
</P>
<P>
"Recent frontier fights between the two border security forces
and intrusion by Indians into Bangladesh territories are among the
issues discussed at the talks," an BDR official said.
</P>
<P>
Besides intrusion by the BSF, Indian nationals and law
enforcers, the long-drawn agenda for the border coordination
conference also include matters relating to disputed lands of
Nayagram and Muhurirchar, and firing and casualties in border
areas.
</P>
<P>
Repair and maintenance of border pillars, demarcation of
disputed lands, woman and child trafficking and smuggling will
also come for discussion, the BDR sources said.
</P>
<P>
During last week, the border guards of Bangladesh and India
fought a series of battles in two frontiers, Northeastern Sylet
and Northwestern Kurigram, where three Bangladeshi civilians were
killed. India claimed its two BSF members were killed in the
border clashes.
</P>
<P>
One hundred Bangladeshi, including six BDR personnel, were shot
dead and 106 injured in incidents of firing by the BSF in border
areas in the last four and a half years, making the 4,156-
kilometer border between the two countries "one of the most
volatile international borders", according to the BDR sources.
</P>
<P>
The border killings have increased since early this year. In
the first six months, 22 Bangladeshis were killed in the
indiscriminate firing by the BSF in different frontiers.
