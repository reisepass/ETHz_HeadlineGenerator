DHAKA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh and India today
signed in New Delhi a long-cherished Ganges water-sharing accord,
which would remove a major irritant in bilateral relations and
pave the way for closer ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year agreement resolving the nagging issue of Ganges
water- sharing was signed by Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina and her Indian counterpart Deve Gowda.
</P>
<P>
The water accord could usher in a new era of bilateral
relations by resolving a host of other outstanding issues through
negotiations in a congenial political atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The Ganges dispute has cast a big shadow over relations between
the two countries ever since India built upstream the river its
Farakka barrier near Bangladesh's northern border in 1974,
restricting the river's flow.
</P>
<P>
Dhaka says India releases excess water during the monsoon
season while it diverts much of the river's water during the dry
season, causing severe drought in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Under the new treaty, Bangladesh can get its due share of the
common river. If the water flow at the barrage is below 70,000
cusecs, the two countries will share the water evenly.
</P>
<P>
If the flow is between 70,000 and 75,000 cusecs, then
Bangladesh will receive 35,000 cusecs. If above 75,000 cusecs,
India will be guaranteed 40,000 cusecs.
</P>
<P>
As there has been no water-sharing agreement since the last one
expired in 1988, the 30-year water accord is regarded as a big
triumph for Sheikh Hasina, who took office just six months ago.
</P>
<P>
Soon after coming to power, the Hasina government took the
initiative to resolve the long-standing Ganges problem and
received a positive response from Deve Gowda, who also took office
in June.
</P>
<P>
"The water accord would be a momentous occasion in bilateral
relations and a stepping stone for greater cooperation between
Bangladesh and India," said Sheikh Hasina.
</P>
<P>
To Bangladesh, relationship with its immediate big neighbor is
both important and sensitive. The main opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist party (BNP) has been accusing Hasina of being
pro-India.
</P>
<P>
Hasina has proposed to purchase electricity from India to meet
an increasing power demand, and the proposal was criticized by the
BNP as giving the "switch" to the giant neighbor to muzzle
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The other outstanding bilateral issues are transit rights for
the movement of Indian goods to the north-eastern states through
Bangladesh and tariff concessions for Bangladesh goods in a bid
to narrow the trade gap, which is now heavily in favor of India.
</P>
<P>
However, political analysts said that Hasina's visit is bound
to generate a lot of goodwill for promoting bilateral relations
since the major irritant is successfully tackled.
</P>
<P>
"The water-sharing agreement now can be a prelude to other
important deals which both countries have wanted to negotiate but
could not do so in the past due to bitterness against each other,"
claimed an Indian diplomat.
