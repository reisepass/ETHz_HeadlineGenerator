NEW DELHI, December 12 (Xinhua) -- India and Bangladesh today
clinched a historic deal on the sharing of Ganges water, which
will remove a major irritant in the bilateral relations in more
than two decades.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, valid for 30 years, was signed by Indian Prime
Minister H.D. Deve Gowda and visiting Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina on the third day of the latter's official visit to
India.
</P>
<P>
Gowda and Hasina signed the pact after two rounds of talks.
</P>
<P>
The two countries had argued over the sharing of the Ganges
water ever since 1970 when India constructed a dam at Farakka,
West Bengal, which is said to have caused water shortages in
Bangladesh, especially in the lean season between January and May.
</P>
<P>
A bilateral agreement was signed in 1977 on sharing the waters
in Farakka region for five years, which expired in 1988 after two
renewals.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations for a new pact dragged on for years as India had
insisted that a solution to the dispute should be linked to
India's transit right through Bangladesh to its eastern states.
</P>
<P>
Prospects for a once-for-all solution brightened a few months
ago when new governments were installed in both countries in June.
</P>
<P>
In a significant gesture, India agreed to separate the
water-sharing problem from the transit issue, giving a major boost
to the negotiations on the prolonged dispute.
</P>
<P>
Foreign secretaries and external affairs ministers of the two
countries exchanged several visits in the past few months and
paved the way for a summit to sign the landmark deal.
