NEW DELHI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee and his Bangladesh counterpart, Sheikh Hasina,
held wide-ranging talks here Tuesday on matters of mutual interest
for boosting the ties between their two countries, official
sources said here.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee held one-to-one talks with Hasina, who arrived here
Tuesday morning on a one-day visit to India, followed by
delegation-level discussions on issues covering trade, investment,
tariff concessions and cooperation in various fields, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Hasina is the first chief of government to visit India after it
conducted five underground nuclear tests on May 11 and 13 this
year.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after her arrival, Hasina had a meeting with India's
former Prime Minister I. K. Gujral, who established good
neighborly relations with India's neighbors.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Indian Foreign Office said here Monday that
Hasina's visit had nothing to do with Indo-Pakistan relations and
it was purely a bilateral event. India is opposed to any third
party mediation in Indo-Pak matters.
