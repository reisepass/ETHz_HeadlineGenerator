   HOUSTON _ Astronauts will make an emergency shuttle flight to
the $3.8 billion Hubble Space Telescope in mid-October to replace
failing components in the mechanism that points the large
observatory at distant stars, NASA said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Working from the shuttle Discovery, four veteran astronauts will
make three to four spacewalks to replace all six of the Hubble's
gyroscopes and make other repairs. All four astronauts have been in
training since mid-1998 for a Hubble servicing mission that had
been scheduled for June 2000.
</P>
<P>
   However, without an expedited visit by a shuttle repair crew,
NASA could be forced to call a halt to Hubble observations, said Ed
Weiler, NASA's chief space scientist. Those observations have
included faint galaxies on the frontiers of the universe, stellar
nurseries, black holes and other mysterious objects that have
become the hallmark of Hubble activities for the past nine years.
</P>
<P>
   The spin of the gyroscopes enables the telescope's computers and
other electronics to accurately point the telescope. Weiler and
others responsible for the 13-ton, five-story observatory stressed
that the spacecraft is in no danger of drifting away or plunging
through the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a so-called spacecraft emergency,'' Weiler said.
``We think of this as more of a science emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   At least three of the gyroscopes must spin to maintain the
three-dimensional reference in space required by the telescope to
point precisely.
</P>
<P>
   Two gyroscopes have failed since the most recent visit to the
the telescope by shuttle astronauts in February 1997. A third
gyroscope faltered Jan. 25, and has been placed in a standby mode,
leaving the minimum needed for observations.
</P>
<P>
   Telescope engineers calculate an 80 percent likelihood of a
fourth failure if the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
waits until mid-2000 to send a shuttle crew.
</P>
<P>
   Experts have traced the problem to breaks in the two hair-thin
wires of copper and silver that supply electricity to the spin
motor of each gyroscope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the telescope is working just fine and we see no
day-to-day impact in our normal science operations from any of
these issues with the gyroscopes,'' said David Leckrone, the
Hubble's senior project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight
Center in Greenbelt, Md.
</P>
<P>
   But with the loss of a fourth gyroscope, ground control teams
would be forced to begin to curtail observations. When it finally
fails, the telescope will slip into an electronic slumber called
``safe mode.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the gyroscopes are at least 11-years-old and the oldest
is 14-years-old. Two of the three fully functioning gyroscopes are
among those originally installed on the telescope.
</P>
<P>
   NASA believes the mission will take nine days.
</P>
<P>
   The seven months it has to prepare for the flight will be the
shortest for any it has attempted, and there is a possibility NASA
could advance the launch into late September. The commander, pilot
and robot arm operator will be named later this week, joining the
spacewalking team of Mike Foale, John Grunsfeldand Steve Smith of
the United States, and Claude Nicollier of Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``This flight will be a challenge, I can tell you that,'' said
NASA's Linda Ham, who will serve as the lead flight director for
the mission.
</P>
<P>
   Following a rendezvous at 360 miles above the Earth, the 50-foot
shuttle arm will be used to grab Hubble and carefully mount it on a
work platform in Discovery's cargo bay.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the gyroscopes, the spacewalkers will install a
new flight computer on the telescope as well as a data recorder and
transmitter. They also are prepared to replace reflective
insulation on the exterior of the Hubble, which is deteriorating
from its long exposure to corrosive elements in the Earth's upper
atmosphere and to radiation.
</P>
<P>
   The exterior damage was a surprise when first detected by
shuttle astronauts who last visited the space telescope in February
1997. Smith was among them and participated in makeshift repairs
from materials the 1997 crew scrounged from the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   The Hubble has never been trouble free. The observatory was
launched in April 1990 after years of delay caused by the fatal
Challenger shuttle accident of 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, NASA discovered that an optical flaw had escaped
detection before launching. It rendered the spacecraft near-sighted
and hurt the space agency's public credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the orbiting telescope was designed for regular
upgrades by visiting shuttle astronauts. NASA restored the losses
with a much-publicized rescue mission in December 1993 that
featured a record five spacewalks.
</P>
<P>
   Since them, the telescope has enabled astronomers to boast of
discovery after discovery. Those include almost irrefutable
evidence of super-massive black holes; images of dust disks around
distant stars that appear to be planetary systems in formation; and
the first image of a planet outside the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   Hubble is enabling astronomers to refine estimates of the age of
the universe and recently bolstered theories that the universe will
continue to expand without limit.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency recently decided to operate the telescope
through 2010 instead of phasing out operations five years earlier.
In addition to the emergency mission, shuttle astronauts will
return to the Hubble sometime between late 2000 and the spring of
2001 to install a powerful new camera, install new electricity
generating solar arrays and to replace the cooling system for the
powerful infrared detectors installed in 1997.
