 *NASA to launch emergency repair trip to telescope    	
</P>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA will launch an emergency repair  
mission this fall to the Hubble Space Telescope, which is in danger 
of shutting down. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA decided Wednesday to move up the next regularly scheduled  
Hubble visit to October so that spacewalking astronauts can fix the 
telescope's deteriorating pointing system. The mission had been set 
for June 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Hubble's six gyroscopes, needed for pointing and  
stability, have failed since astronauts' last service call, in 
1997. And a third gyroscope is partly broken and is considered 
unreliable. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronomers need at least three perfect gyroscopes to conduct  
observations throughout the universe. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are one failure away from losing science,'' said Ed Weiler,  
head of NASA's space science program. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the $2 billion telescope would be safe in orbit without  
any working gyroscopes, NASA does not want to risk losing any 
valuable science time. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a so-called spacecraft emergency where we're in  
danger of losing the entire mission or the entire spacecraft,'' 
Weiler said. ``You can think of it more as a science emergency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, the original 2000 mission will be divided into  
two parts: the first will be launched around mid-October aboard 
Discovery and the second in late 2000 or early 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides replacing all six gyroscopes in October, spacewalking  
astronauts will install a new computer, radio transmitter, guidance 
sensor and data recorder, and fix peeling insulation. 
</P>
<P>
	During their second visit, the same astronauts will equip Hubble  
with new solar panels, an advanced camera and a newfangled cooling 
unit for an infrared camera that has run out of the frozen nitrogen 
needed for observations. 
</P>
<P>
	The four astronauts who will do the repairs have been training  
since last summer and can easily accommodate the early flight, NASA 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The extra mission will cost NASA $75 million more than what's  
been budgeted for Hubble. But Weiler called it ``a rather good 
insurance policy'' considering the science that might be lost if 
NASA were to wait until next summer to make the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubble was launched in 1990 with a misshapen mirror.  
Spacewalking astronauts corrected the telescope's vision in 1993, 
restoring Hubble to a world-class instrument able to see to the 
fringes of the universe, and returned in 1997 to add or replace 11 
major parts. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA will have to rearrange the shuttle flight schedule to  
squeeze in the Hubble mission. Those details have yet to be worked 
out.
