   HOUSTON _ A pair of spacewalking astronauts on Wednesday began
the intricate process of repairing the dormant Hubble Space
Telescope, replacing the faulty gyroscopes that forced the
observatory into hibernation last month.
</P>
<P>
   With one astronaut standing on the end of the shuttle
Discovery's 50-foot robot arm and the other hooked to the
telescope, the men used power wrenches and other tools to
laboriously pull out three boxes that each contained two of
Hubble's six stabilizing gyroscopes and replace them with new
units.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Herring, a spokesman for Mission Control here at the
Johnson Space Center, said the three new units containing the
crucial gyroscopes necessary to point and steady the telescope had
been activated and seemed to be working properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``All appears at this point to be in good shape with Hubble
essentially back in business,'' Herring said.
</P>
<P>
   The astronauts, Steven L. Smith and John M. Grunsfeld, started
the first of three planned spacewalks at 1:54 p.m., about an hour
earlier than scheduled to tackle the most important and difficult
part of the repair mission.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping out of an airlock as the shuttle Discovery passed over
Australia, Smith, a veteran spacewalker who has flown on two
previous shuttle missions, said to his colleague, ``You ready to
go?'' and added, ``Hubble needs us.''
</P>
<P>
   Grunsfeld, a physicist on his third shuttle flight but a novice
spacewalker, said ``Beautiful sight out here'' as he stepped into
Discovery's cargo bay. ``Hello Hubble,'' he said looking up at the
43-foot observatory towering above him, ``That's one beautiful
telescope.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubble has been out of commission since Nov. 13, when a fourth
gyroscope failed, rendering the telescope incapable of holding
steady enough to conduct scientific observations. The observatory
powered down and went into a protective ``safe mode'' awaiting its
orbital repair crew.
</P>
<P>
   Working from lockers in the payload bay that contain scores of
tools and replacement parts, the astronauts repeatedly carried new
equipment up to the 25,000-pound telescope secured to a cradle
above and brought down old parts that will be returned to Earth for
examination.
</P>
<P>
   After the gyroscope exchange, which took about an hour longer
than expected, the spacewalk team moved to open valves on a cooling
unit attached to a disabled infrared camera to purge nitrogen
coolant. This was to prepare the camera unit, inoperative because
of an earlier coolant leak, for a replacement cooling device to be
installed on a service mission set for 2001. The astronauts
initially could not remove caps covering the valves, but later
forced them off and completed the task.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Smith and Grunsfeld installed voltage regulator kits on
Hubble's six aging batteries. The six Voltage-Temperature
Improvement Kits were designed to improve the batteries' efficiency
while keeping them from overcharging and overheating during periods
of low power use.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a team made up of the NASA astronaut C. Michael
Foale and Claude Nicollier of the European Space Agency is to
conduct the second spacewalk starting in the early afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The astronauts are to replace Hubble's central computer with a
new, faster model and exchange one of the telescope's three Fine
Guidance Sensors with a refurbished unit. These sensors let the
telescope locked onto a target for hours or days at a time.
