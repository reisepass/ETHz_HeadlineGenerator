	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mechanical problems that threaten to shut down  
the astronomical observations of the Hubble Space Telescope may 
prompt a repair mission six months earlier than planned to the $1.7 
billion spacecraft, NASA officials told Congress on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is ailing gyroscopes, said Daniel Goldin, the  
administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
Gyroscopes are used for the stability and fine pointing the Hubble 
needs to gather light from stars billions of light years away. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of all gyroscopes would mean the space telescope could  
not make astronomical observations, but it would not threaten the 
spacecraft, officials said. Instead, the failure of the gyros would 
cause the craft to go into an automatic ``safe mode'' until the 
repairs are made. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hubble was launched in 1990 and immediately had problems.  
Astronomers discovered that the 2.4-meter mirror on the telescope 
had been ground to the wrong curvature and the instrument, in 
effect, was nearsighted. 
</P>
<P>
	But a new set of optics installed by astronauts in 1993  
corrected the problem. And since then, the Hubble has made 
photographs of tens of thousands of previously unseen galaxies, 
giving unprecedented views of the heavens. Some of the stellar 
targets are more than 13 billion light years away, near the 
theoretical edge of the universe. The Hubble was designed to remain 
operational until 2010. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hubble needs three gyroscopes to work properly and it has  
lost two of its six. Another gyro ``is sick and may go down in 
three months,'' Goldin said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Hubble loses a fourth gyro, it will have to be shut down  
until a space shuttle crew goes up to the orbiting telescope and 
installs a new set of gyroscopes, he said. A decision about an 
emergency mission is expected no later than next week. 
</P>
<P>
	For practical planning, the spacecraft is already on the edge of  
losing gyroscope control because one of the remaining four control 
instruments ``is quite ill,'' said David S. Leckrone, senior 
project scientist for the telescope. 
</P>
<P>
	``If another gyro fails, we would not put the fourth gyro back  
into service,'' he said, meaning that the Hubble is only one 
failure away from being shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is in wires that carry power to the rapidly spinning  
gyroscopes. The gyros can operate on either of the two wires, but 
when one wire breaks, it causes an increase in voltage carried by 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
	In earlier gyroscope failures, engineers saw a sudden increase  
in voltage carried by one wire. Within weeks, that wire also 
failed. One wire has already failed in the ailing gyro, said 
Leckrone. 
</P>
<P>
	Should all of Hubble's gyroscopes shut down, he said, the  
spacecraft would switch automatically to a safe mode that keeps its 
solar power array pointed at the sun. As long as the craft is 
powered by the sun, engineers on the ground can control it. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA already had planned for a June 2000, Hubble servicing  
mission that would include replacing all of the gyroscopes, along 
with a computer and some other instruments. But Leckrone said he 
and others at the Goddard Spaceflight Center have proposed that an 
emergency mission be flown this October to change out the ailing 
gyros, and that the rest of the serving be done on a mission in 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	An earlier servicing mission to change cameras and other  
equipment was flown in 1997, and a final servicing mission is 
planned for 2003.
