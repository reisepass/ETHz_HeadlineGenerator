   HOUSTON _ The fourth of six gyroscopes aboard the orbiting
Hubble Space Telescope has faltered, forcing an abrupt halt to all
celestial observations and lending new urgency to a December space
shuttle repair mission, NASA said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Spacewalking astronauts have trained to replace all six of the
gyroscopes and make other repairs during the 10-day flight of the
shuttle Discovery. The shuttle is to lift off with a crew of seven,
including a quartet of spacewalkers, on Dec. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's failure left the 13-ton, 43-foot long telescope with
only two operable gyroscopes. At least three are required to carry
out observations of stars, galaxies and other celestial phenomena.
</P>
<P>
   The high-revving gyroscopes are among the most crucial
components of the telescope's pointing system, which enables
ground-based astronomers to aim and lock the space telescope onto
distant, faint objects for lengthy observations.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating additional gyroscope losses, NASA in March
announced an unscheduled servicing call by shuttle astronauts,
weeks after a third Hubble gyroscope faltered. The gyroscopes were
designed for periodic replacement. NASA places the gyroscope
replacement portion of the upcoming $205 million mission at $8
million.
</P>
<P>
   The next scheduled shuttle visit to Hubble had been planned for
mid-2000. Initially, the agency planned to move the flight to
mid-October, but that changed with the July launching of the
shuttle Columbia with the Chandra X-ray Observatory.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after liftoff, Columbia experienced an electrical short
that was traced to insulation damage on internal wiring. The
finding forced a suspension of all shuttle flights until Discovery,
Endeavour, Atlantis and Columbia could be inspected and repaired.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery was towed to its launch pad at NASA's Kennedy Space
Center in Florida on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the latest gyroscope failure forced the space
telescope into an electronic slumber called a ``safe mode.'' The
operating mode ensures that the telescope continues to generate
electricity for its scientific equipment and flight controls,
though it is unable to point at celestial targets.
</P>
<P>
   The gyroscope stopped after experiencing a sudden power surge.
The previous failures followed successive electrical
irregularities, some spanning several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This underscores the wisdom of scheduling this call-up service
mission,'' said David Leckrone, the Hubble's senior project
scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.,
where the observatory is managed. ``We will only lose about three
weeks of science observations. Had we not split the mission and
proceeded with our June 2000 mission we would be facing a
seven-month interruption.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to replacing all six gyroscopes next month,
spacewalking astronauts plan to install a faster flight computer, a
solid state data recorder, a new transmitter, another large
guidance device as well as new external insulation.
