   HOUSTON _ The Hubble Space Telescope got smarter and better able
to point at distant astronomical targets on Thursday as
spacewalking astronauts replaced two major pieces of the
observatory's gear.
</P>
<P>
   On the second spacewalk of the shuttle Discovery's Hubble repair
mission, the astronauts, C. Michael Foale and Claude Nicollier,
swapped out the observatory's central computer and one of its fine
guidance sensors, a precision pointing device.
</P>
<P>
   The spacewalkers ventured into Discovery's cargo bay, where
Hubble towers almost four stories above, at 2:06 p.m. EST, about 45
minutes earlier than scheduled, to get a jump on their busy day of
replacing some of the telescope's most important components.
</P>
<P>
   The excursion followed the first spacewalk by Steven L. Smith
and John M. Grunsfeld on Wednesday. They replaced Hubble's six
stabilizing gyroscopes, the focus of the mission, and added
protective devices to the observatory's six aging batteries to
prevent them from overheating and overcharging.
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials said Thursday that initial tests of the
gyroscopes and the voltage-temperature improvement kits for the
batteries showed that they were properly installed and in good
working order.
</P>
<P>
   John Campbell, NASA's Hubble program manager, declared the
repair mission's objectives 80 percent complete with the success of
the first spacewalk. Hubble, scheduled to be released by Discovery
on Christmas Day, should be back on the job making scientific
observations about two weeks later, Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   In the second of three scheduled spacewalks, Foale and Nicollier
got to work immediately upon exiting the shuttle, which was flying
above Australia at the time.
</P>
<P>
   For Nicollier, a Swiss astronaut with the European Space Agency
who has flown on three previous shuttle flights, including the
first Hubble service mission in 1993, it was his first spacewalk,
or EVA (for extra-vehicular activity) in NASA terminology.
``Welcome to the EVA fraternity,'' said Smith from inside
Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great privilege to work on Hubble for the astronomical
community all over the world,'' said Nicollier, an astrophysicist,
after first exclaiming, ``What a view!''
</P>
<P>
   Foale, a veteran of five previous shuttle flights and two
earlier spacewalks, led the effort to extract Hubble's central
computer while positioned on a workstation at the end of the
shuttle's 50-foot robot arm. It took more than two hours to replace
the computer and move to the next task, but the astronauts soon got
confirmation that they had succeeded when Mission Control said
initial tests showed that the computer was functioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hubble not only has new brains, it's thinking,'' said
Steven Robinson, mission communicator at the Johnson Space Center
here.
</P>
<P>
   While the new computer is a big improvement for Hubble, having
20 times the speed and six times the memory of the old one, it is
hardly state-of-the-art by current personal computer standards.
</P>
<P>
   Hubble's new brain is powered by an Intel 486-DX2 chip running
at a speed of 25 megahertz, a processor long obsolete in desktop
computers now driven by newer Pentium chips. NASA officials said
computer chips used in space must be specially manufactured and
tested to work in that harsh environment, which keeps them
generations behind what is used on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to keep in mind that we don't do Windows, we don't
have disks and we don't do the Internet,'' Campbell explained,
jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   Following the computer work, the astronauts tackled the
laborious task of exchanging a bulky Fine Guidance Sensor, one of
three optical devices used for precision pointing and measurement.
</P>
<P>
   The 480-pound device is one that was removed during the second
Hubble servicing mission in 1997 and refurbished.
</P>
<P>
   With Nicollier working on the robot arm, the spacewalkers
removed an older sensor and tried to slide the new one into place
along a set of guiderails.
</P>
<P>
   The new unit initially stuck part way into its slot. After
discussion with ground controllers, the astronauts removed it and
were successful on the second attempt. Early tests indicated that
the replacement was working as planned, mission officials said.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The old guidance sensor was stowed on the shuttle and will be
refurbished for reinstallation on the telescope during a service
mission planned for 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's walk in space is to be the only one for Foale and
Nicollier during this mission. When the mission was planned, the
pair had been scheduled to make another excursion, but that EVA was
canceled when Discovery's much delayed flight was cut from 10 to
eight days.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Grunsfeld are to make the third and final spacewalk of
the mission on Friday, when they will replace a faulty radio
transmitter and exchange a tape data recorder with a solid-state
model. The telescope is scheduled to be released into space on
Saturday. Discovery is set to return to Earth on Monday.
