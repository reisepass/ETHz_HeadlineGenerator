   ATLANTA -- Maybe, just maybe, customers who pay to use bank ATM
machines are beginning to fight back. Or maybe they're just getting
smarter.
</P>
<P>
   Many are shifting to their own banks' machines to avoid being
charged twice for their transactions -- one fee by the bank that
owns the ATM, if it is a bank other than their own, and another fee
by their own bank. At the same time, the surcharges continue to
rise, new studies show.
</P>
<P>
   The surveys were seized by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R-N.Y.),
chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, who said recently he'll
get the Senate to vote this year on legislation to ban banks'
practice of making double charges on ATM transactions.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the number of ATMs has greatly expanded. There
are now more than 150,000 automated teller machines nationwide, and
there were almost 11 billion ATM transactions last year, according
to the American Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the rise in ATM use, however, has come a jump in the
fees charged by banks to use the ATMs. Use an ATM owned by a bank
other than your bank, and that ``foreign'' bank may charge you as
much as $1.50.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the charge can come with a double whammy, a $3 charge
if your bank also charges $1.50, which some do, for processing your
withdrawal from the other bank's ATM.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous that customers sometimes are charged twice to
get access to their own money,'' said Robert Pregulman, an Atlanta
spokesman for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a national
consumer group.
</P>
<P>
   That consumer sentiment apparently is reflected in two recent
surveys that indicate some consumers have begun limiting their use
of ``foreign'' bank ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   A survey in April of 3,100 consumers by PSI Global, a market
research firm, found heavy ATM users -- those who conduct five or
more transactions each month -- had reduced their use of
``foreign'' ATMs by 22 percent in the last two years. They had
reduced all ATM transactions by 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The behavior of the heavy users, the shifting away from
`foreign' ATMs and declining transactions, might be an indication
that the market has reached, or nearly reached an optimal price
point,'' said Mimi Rossetti, director of research for Tampa-based
PSI Global.
</P>
<P>
   Most banks don't charge their own customers for using bank-owned
ATMs, so more consumers are using them to save ATM fees. Also,
Rossetti said consumers who use ``foreign'' ATMs are apparently
withdrawing larger amounts of cash to reduce the number of
fee-charged withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the ``heavy users,'' PSI Global found that all
ATM users in its survey had reduced their use of ``foreign'' ATMs
by 18 percent during the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   A March survey by Market Facts Inc., conducted for the ABA,
found nearly two of three consumers said they had changed their ATM
use to avoid paying fees. But the ABA used the survey to justify
charging fees for the ``convenience'' of other banks' ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fees enable banks to set up many more ATMs on street
corners, and in airports, grocery stores, malls, convenience stores
and hospitals,'' said Walter A. Dodds Jr., ABA president. ``Why
should institutions give convenience away, for free, to people who
don't bank with them?''
