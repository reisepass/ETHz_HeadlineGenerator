   ATLANTA _ The fees banks charge for using ATM machines to
withdraw money increasingly are under attack by state governments,
cities _ even the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The latest battleground is San Francisco, where residents will
vote today on a measure to ban the fees. Connecticut, Iowa and
Santa Monica, Calif., already have banned the charges, which
nationwide average $1.27 per transaction, according to a study by
the U.S. Public Interest Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said last month it is considering abolishing them
on military bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are fed up with ATM fees and the general trend
in banks to gouge them with fees,'' said Jon Golinger, director of
the California Public Interest Research Group, which is pushing the
fee ban in San Francisco. ``This has become a big consumer issue.''
</P>
<P>
   But not in Georgia _ so far. In the Atlanta area, the charge
averages $1.38, according to Bankrate.com. That is above the
national average, but there is no anti-fee fervor.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Banking Commissioner Steve Bridges said his office has
fielded under 10 complaints regarding ATM fees in the past year. He
said he thinks consumers know they can avoid ATM fees either by
wisely managing their cash or using their own banks' machines.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators also say they haven't heard much complaining from
Georgia consumers. However, state Sen. Ed Harbison (D-Columbus),
vice-chairman of the Senate Banking &AMP; Financial Institutions
Committee, said the issue may come up next session.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is any evidence of abuse we should look into it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Large interstate banks say no one but Congress can tell them
what to do. As a result, they say, the bans on fees will only
affect state-chartered banks and credit unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What ability do state and local entities have to regulate
federally chartered banks?'' said Mathew Street, associate general
counsel for the American Bankers Association. ``I would say none.
As this issue goes forward, it is the question that will be
answered in the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Banks maintain that the fees are simply paying for the growth of
the ATM network, not adding to the bottom line. Consumers should
look at the fees as the cost of conveniently accessing cash, the
banks say.
</P>
<P>
   The fees are often doubled, though, when both banks assess them.
This can cause fees in excess of $3 per transaction.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., banks
generated $489 billion in revenue 1998. About $20 billion was
fee-based revenue, an 8 percent increase over 1997. Fee-based
revenue includes, but is not limited to, ATM fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't have the fees, we wouldn't be able to put out the
number of ATMs we have,'' said Joe Brannen, president and chief
executive officer of the Georgia Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Brannen said the fees simply generate enough revenue to keep the
ATM network growing.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America, SouthTrust Bank and SunTrust Bank all declined
to disclose the costs to set up and maintain an ATM, citing
proprietary reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Bernhardt, a professor of marketing at Georgia State
University, doesn't entirely buy into the argument that fees simply
cover costs. Bernhardt said banks use fees to supplement revenues
lost because of low interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   He said fees are rising across the board; from ATM fees to
bounced check fees to stop payment fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is earnings pressure out there, and the banks have got
to make it up in fees,'' Bernhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether state banking law has precedent over
federally chartered banks is just starting to unfold in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Last month in Iowa, banks scored a victory when the 8th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals said federal law prohibits a state from
regulating national banks' ATM fees. The decision threatens that
state's 8-year-old ban on ATM fees.
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa Division of Banking is appealing the court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, the state Supreme Court is set to make a
decision by the end of the year on that state's ATM fee ban which
was instituted two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said a ruling in
favor of the state's ATM fee ban could cause other states to
implement their own measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think other states around the country will follow our
lead,'' he said. ``It will send a powerful signal to the banks that
we can stop the fees that have nickled and dimed and, now, dollared
consumers to distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Thorne of Atlanta said he's fed up with fees.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Thorne, a SouthTrust customer, was on his lunch hour
when he used a Bank of America ATM despite facing a $3 surcharge;
$1.50 from Bank of America and $1.50 from SouthTrust.
</P>
<P>
   For Thorne, fees are a necessary evil of being able to get money
on an hour lunch break.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those things that you don't like, but you have to
put up with it anyway.''
