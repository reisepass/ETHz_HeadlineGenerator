    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Fleet Bank and BankBoston began imposing a fee on
non-customers who use their more than 500 Connecticut ATMs Monday, a move that
was criticized even by some Fleet customers.
<P>
	   The decision follows a state Supreme Court ruling last month that the state
did not have the power to block the fees. The $1 fee applies to patrons who use
the ATMs but do not have an account with Fleet or BankBoston, who recently
merged.
</P>
<P>
	   The fee - the so-called ATM surcharge - comes on top of a fee that other
banks may charge when their customers use another bank's ATM. The surcharge is
levied at the time of the transaction.
</P>
<P>
	   "It stinks," said Fleet customer Mirna Nevas, the owner of a small language
school in Burlington. "They're gouging people. You shouldn't be charged to
access your money."
</P>
<P>
	   Judy Santasiere of Simsbury, also a Fleet customer, was interviewed at a
downtown Hartford bank Monday. She said she thought the decision to resume
imposing the surcharge was "too bad, because the ATM is a convenience for the
bank as well as the customer."
</P>
<P>
	   "It definitely stinks," agreed John Gallacher, a Fleet customer from West
Hartford.
</P>
<P>
	   With 518 machines, the merged banks now have about 29 percent of the ATMs in
Connecticut. That will fall to about 24 percent once Fleet-BankBoston divests
about 85 ATMs later this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Charlotte, N.C.-based First Union National Bank added the surcharge to its
roughly 100 Connecticut machines last month. The two largest Connecticut-based
banks - People's and Webster - said they are still trying to determine whether
they will impose the surcharge. Another bank, Providence-based Citizens Bank,
also said it has not decided.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Schepker, a Fleet spokesman in Hartford, said signs will be posted on
ATMs warning of the surcharge, and machines have been programmed to let users
cancel transactions to avoid it.
</P>
<P>
	   Bankers who support the surcharge say it is reasonable to charge
non-customers for convenient access to cash. Non-customers tend to be frequent
users who withdraw small amounts of cash, and as a result increase
machine-maintenance costs.
</P>
<P>
	   But consumer advocates say the surcharge is an unfair practice which
generated more than $2 billion in nationwide revenue for banks last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Part of the fee consumers pay to their own bank when they use another bank's
ATM already goes back to the bank that owns the machine. But that portion, some
banks argue, is not enough to help run expansive ATM networks owned by the
bigger banks.
</P>
<P>
	   Fleet has said it has lost up to $15,000 a day in revenue in Connecticut for
each day it has not imposed the non-customer fee. Over three years, the total
would have amounted to up to $15.8 million.
