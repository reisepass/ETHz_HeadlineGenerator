   BOSTON _ Fleet Financial Group said Monday that it would
temporarily freeze its automatic teller surcharge in Massachusetts
at 75 cents, its current level, and roll back BankBoston's fee once
the two banks formally merge.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet, which expects to receive final approval for its
acquisition of BankBoston Corp as early as next month, said it
would reduce BankBoston's ATM surcharge to 75 cents from its
current $1.
</P>
<P>
   The rates are in force until 2001 and apply only to ATMs in
Massachusetts. In Connecticut, Rhode Island, and other states where
Fleet and BankBoston are active, both companies charge non-clients
$1 to use their ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   Surcharges are fees that banks charge customers from other banks
for using their ATMs. Fleet and BankBoston, which collectively own
more than half of Massachusetts' 3,500 ATMs, do not charge their
own customers fees to access their machines but penalize them for
using other banks' outlets. BankBoston is the state's largest ATM
operator, with over 1,330 machines.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet, New England's leading bank, said it agreed to limit ATM
fees after the State Treasurer's office protested that the
acquisition of BankBoston would result in excessively high charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the issues that the treasurer raised were
constructive and reasonable and we responded accordingly,'' said
Fleet spokesman James Mahoney.
</P>
<P>
   The freeze and rollback will save customers approximately $4.5
million through the end of next year, according to the State
Treasurer's office. Customers of other banks who use Fleet's and
BankBoston's machines already pay fees below the national average
of $1.32.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet, which will become the nation's eighth largest bank after
acquiring BankBoston, is free to boost fees come 2001, and may
choose to follow a national trend and increase surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps with that in mind, Fleet shunned Treasurer Shannon P.
O'Brien's request that its freeze and rollback stand for at least
the first two years following the merger. Fleet also declined
O'Brien's suggestion that the new bank designate 125 ATMs as
surcharge-free for two years. The bank said such a move would
create market imbalances for its customers.
</P>
<P>
   ATM surcharges are a contentious matter among banks, which say
they cannot afford to provide free services to non-clients, and
consumer advocates, who say the charges eat away at depositors'
pocketbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Sovereign Bancorp, which is acquiring over 360 ATMs from Fleet
and BankBoston as it moves into the region, has said it does not
plan to charge fees exceeding those of its local competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts has been among the most aggressive states in
seeking, so far unsuccessfully, to ban ATM surcharges. Only
Connecticut and Iowa have banned the levies.
