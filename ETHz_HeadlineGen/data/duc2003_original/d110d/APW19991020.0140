	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon, moving to help financially  
strapped military personnel, has proposed banning ATM surcharges on 
all U.S. military bases, both in the United States and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department issued the proposal for public comment in  
August, and the comment period ended last Tuesday. A decision is 
expected within 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal ``is a nuclear bomb that spells the beginning of  
the end of the ATM fee rip-off,'' Jon Golinger, consumer program 
director for California Public Interest Research Group, said in a 
statement Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	His group is among several organizing a Nov. 2 ballot  
proposition banning ATM surcharges in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks levy the highly unpopular surcharges for the use of their  
automated teller machines by people who are not their customers. 
The fees come on top of any charges by the ATM users' own banks for 
using ATMs operated by other banks. The surcharges now average 
$1.20 at banks and $1.15 at savings and loans, according to a 
report the Federal Reserve submitted to Congress this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups oppose the surcharges, which are banned in  
Connecticut and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking industry generally defends them, insisting that ATM  
fees are clearly disclosed and are warranted for the 24-hour 
convenience ATMs give customers.
