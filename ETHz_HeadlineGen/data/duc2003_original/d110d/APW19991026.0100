	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A proposal to ban those $1 or $2 ATM  
surcharges goes before voters for the first time next month in San 
Francisco, setting the stage for a court battle. 
</P>
<P>
	There is little doubt the ban will pass, but it is certain to  
face a legal challenge from the banking industry, which contends 
that federally chartered banks are not subject to local and state 
laws. No court in the nation has ruled specifically on an ATM fee 
ban. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco's initiative is the latest sign of growing  
consumer outrage over the cash-machine fees, which are usually 
charged when customers withdraw money from a bank other the one 
where they hold an account. 
</P>
<P>
	The surcharges averaged $1.20 in a 1998 study by the Federal  
Reserve and have become almost universal across the country in the 
last three years. 
</P>
<P>
	In Southern California, Santa Monica city officials have already  
passed a ban on surcharges. It takes effect Nov. 12. A dozen other 
California communities are considering bans, including Los Angeles 
and San Diego, said Jon Golinger of the California Public Interest 
Research Group, which has led the no-surcharge campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut and Iowa have used existing laws to ban ATM  
surcharges. And last week, the Pentagon said it would consider a 
ban on ATM fees on U.S. military bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has thus far rejected legislation that would eliminate  
surcharges nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks say the charges are simply the price of 24-hour  
convenience and help pay for their growing networks of ATMs. But 
opponents say they fees are unjustifiable at a time of soaring bank 
profits, teller layoffs and branch closings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why do they have to charge? They never did it before,'' asked  
Carney Campion, a San Francisco resident who tore up his ATM card a 
few weeks ago in frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	Golinger sees the San Francisco initiative as a way to  
accelerate efforts to get rid of the fees elsewhere. ``This is a 
bottom-up event,'' he said. ``In the end, surcharges will be banned 
just about everywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to a 1997 government report, the surcharges aren't  
needed to cover the costs of ATM transactions. The report said the 
average ATM transaction costs banks 27 cents, while transactions 
with tellers cost up to $2.93 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the banks argue that the fees help pay to install more  
ATMs, which are needed as cash-machine use increases and branches 
close. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a way of having non-customers share in the burden of  
maintaining that network,'' said California Bankers Association 
spokesman John Stafford. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Bankers Association warns that banning the fees  
would force banks to bar ATM use by non-account holders and shut 
down tens of thousands of the machines. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief legal argument against local surcharge bans is that  
only the federal government can regulate the ATMs of national 
banks, which operate 90 percent of the machines covered by San 
Francisco's initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	Each side in the legal dispute can point to favorable language  
in court decisions on related issues. 
</P>
<P>
	In Iowa, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last month said  
federal law prohibits states from regulating national banks' ATMs. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers  
California and eight other Western states, reached the opposite 
conclusion in 1990. In a ruling that predated ATM surcharges, the 
court said Congress ``has declined to restrict state regulation in 
the ATM context.''
