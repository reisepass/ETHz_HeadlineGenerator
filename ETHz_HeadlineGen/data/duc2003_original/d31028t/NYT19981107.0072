   MANAGUA, Nicaragua _ A natural disaster as terrible as Hurricane
Mitch, which killed more than 10,000 people in Central America in
the past two weeks and left nearly 1 million more homeless, teaches
a lot about the way a society does or does not work. Some
institutions and individuals rise to the occasion; others topple
like palm trees in the wind. But the nations of the region always
seem to respond in ways that illuminate their history and
character.
</P>
<P>
   Nicaragua, for instance, is still grappling with many of the
same problems it could not resolve in the 1980s, when the
Sandinista National Liberation Front was trying to fend off
U.S.-backed Contra rebels in a bloody civil war. In that polarized
political climate, the relief effort here last week was hampered by
petty partisan squabbling; the conservative government and the
Sandinistas, who are now in opposition, even disagreed over whether
it would be more appropriate to declare a ``national disaster'' or
a ``state of emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   As people in Posoltega, where more than 1,500 people died in
mudslides, waited for help alongside other devastated towns, the
two camps jockeyed for control of the distribution of food and
medicine _ and the political benefits to come with that.
</P>
<P>
   By late in the week, with popular discontent rising, the damage
caused by the partisanship seemed to impress even some politicians.
President Arnoldo Aleman said he would cede the supervision of
relief activities to the Roman Catholic Church, while Gen. Joaquin
Cuadra, the Sandinista who commands the armed forces, belatedly
called for national unity.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent storm, Hurricane Georges, provided insights that
are at least as striking in September. Faced with the threat of
135-mile-per-hour winds, three Caribbean island societies that have
adopted radically different social and political models, even
though they were all once Spanish colonies, responded in
conspicuously different ways.
</P>
<P>
   In Puerto Rico, a U.S. possession, the government leaped into
action as soon as the first hurricane watch was issued. Television
stations repeatedly broadcast warnings to stay indoors and put up
hurricane shutters, provided advice on stockpiling food and water
and showed footage of past storms to remind the island's 3.5
million residents of what they might face. As soon as Georges
passed, utility repair crews were out restoring service and federal
Emergency Management Agency teams were preparing reports and
sending money.
</P>
<P>
   Next door in the Dominican Republic, disorganization was the
watchword. Newspapers there have complained that the civil defense
chief, Elpidio Baez, failed to issue storm warnings because he did
not want to alarm people. He denies that, but television and radio
stations continued to broadcast soap operas and merengue
competitions until just before the storm struck. Some people who
went to hurricane shelters found them closed and were turned away
by soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   There are even reports that officials opened a dam on the verge
of buckling without advising residents living downstream, some of
whom later drowned. The government denies those accounts, but an
official of the U.S. Agency for International Development said it
was clear that overall, ``when the thing hit, they were totally
unprepared to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane then moved on to Cuba, which, true to form for a
militarized totalitarian state, responded as if the storm were an
enemy to be vanquished. President Fidel Castro instructed residents
of affected zones to evacuate, an order that was enforced by the
military and local security watchdogs and may have saved many
lives. Afterward, the Communist Party newspaper Granma praised
Cubans for their ``revolutionary discipline'' and successful
``combat'' against Georges, whose ``destructive force'' amounted to
``a kind of invasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Caribbean basin, though, there is also a common
thread. Just as it seems that hurricanes striking the United States
inevitably gravitate toward trailer parks, here the poorest are
also the most vulnerable and seem to suffer the most, regardless of
who governs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lived through earthquakes, a pair of civil wars,
volcanic eruptions, tidal waves and now this, all in the last 25
years,'' said Maria Lourdes Rodriguez, a peasant who lives north of
here. ``When is God going to take pity on us?''
