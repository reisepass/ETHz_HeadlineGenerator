	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Searchers recovered more bodies
over the weekend from tons of gravel deposited by storm flooding in
a southeastern Haitian town, pushing the national death toll from
Hurricane Georges past 150, officials said Monday.
	   Seventeen bodies were recovered in Fonds Verrettes, a mountain
town 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Port-au-Prince, bringing the
town's death toll to 102, said Rep. Francois Sanozier, who
represents the area.
	   Earlier, officials said at least 85 people were killed in Fonds
Verrettes, population 27,000. The nationwide death toll of at least
150 people was released before the 17 new victims of the Sept. 23
floods were recovered.
	   In all, Georges killed at least 430 people throughout the
Caribbean.
	   Forty years ago, Fonds Verrettes flourished at the foot of
wooded mountains, but farm incomes fell and impoverished peasants
cut down trees to make charcoal. With no forest cover to absorb
Georges' torrential rains, storm runoff crashed through the town,
destroying dozens of homes and buildings.
	   ``We asked the government to build drainage canals. But nothing
was done. Now it is too late,'' said Fonds Verrettes Mayor Nelson
Frankel.
	   An Interior Ministry spokesman, Phares Pierre, told Radio
Haiti-Inter on Monday that the central government had decided to
relocate the town out of harm's way, but gave no further details.
	   A government delegation brought rice, sugar, beans and water for
hurricane victims on Saturday, and more aid was expected this week.
