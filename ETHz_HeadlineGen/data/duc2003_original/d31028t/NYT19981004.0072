   The voice that haunts Bill Becker is a woman's, filled with
fear, who dialed in the dark on Sept. 25 as Hurricane Georges
reached its 100 mph peak over the Florida Keys. She was huddled in
a closet, her house shaking, a phone in one ear and a portable
radio tuned to WWUS-FM, said Becker, news director of the station.
</P>
<P>
   As water ran under his feet and chunks of concrete ripped out of
the studio roof, Becker chatted with the woman and hundreds of
others in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the only thing connecting these people,'' Becker said.
``They were describing the water rising. They were asking, `How
high is it going to get?' You could hear the howling of the wind in
their phones.''
</P>
<P>
   In an industry dominated by group ownership and satellite-fed
formats with disembodied voices, the sound of neighbors holding
hands on the air seems almost old-fashioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was absolutely essential,'' said the Monroe County sheriff,
Richard Roth. ``We wound up using that as our main source for
supplying information.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, WWUS, owned by Crain Communications of Chicago, is live
only between 7 a.m. and 11 a.m. with news and a flea market. At 11
a.m. the station plugs in an oldies satellite feed from Westwood
One and CNN newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   But shortly after Georges arrived around dawn on Sept. 25, with
30,000 people still in the Keys, the station's general manager, Bob
Soos, opened the phones. Six lines jammed immediately.
</P>
<P>
   At 10 a.m. the satellite dish blew away. By noon an inch of
water had turned the carpets into sponges. Callers reported yachts
floating in back yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't show people you were scared, though I really
was,'' Gene Michaels, the operations manager, said.
</P>
<P>
   As night fell and the worst of the winds struck Key West, studio
lights flickered. Michaels played Don McLean's
eight-and-a-half-minute-long ``American Pie,'' giving him time to
suck up water with a shop vacuum. He signed off at 1 a.m. as the
hurricane headed for the Gulf Coast.
