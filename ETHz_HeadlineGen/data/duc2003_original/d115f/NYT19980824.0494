   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from the decision by a
three-judge federal panel in a lawsuit filed by the House of
Representatives against the Commerce Department over the proposed
use of statistical sampling in the 2000 Census. The decision was
obtained from the federal District Court's Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiff, the United States House of Representatives, seeks
summary judgment against the Department of Commerce and the Bureau
of the Census (``defendants'') in this action challenging
defendants' plan for the 2000 Census. Plaintiff claims that using
statistical sampling to supplement the headcount enumeration used
to apportion representatives among the states violates the Census
Act, 13 U.S.C., and Article I, section 2, clause 3 of the
Constitution. The House seeks a declaration that statistical
sampling is unlawful and/or unconstitutional and an injunction
preventing defendants from using statistical sampling in the 2000
Census. ...
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution requires Congress to conduct an ``actual
Enumeration'' of the population every 10 years ``in such Manner as
they shall by Law direct.'' Congress has delegated broad authority
over the conduct of the census to the Secretary of Commerce through
the Census Act. The Census Act governs the Census Bureau's (the
``Bureau'') gathering of economic, social and demographic data
about the United States, including the decennial apportionment
census mandated by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the constitutional mandate to obtain an ``actual
enumeration'' of the population, ``no census is recognized as
having been wholly successful in achieving that goal.'' The 1990
Census was no exception. According to the Bureau, ``[t)hough better
designed and executed than any previous census, the census in 1990
took a step backward on the fundamental issue of accuracy. For the
first time since the Census Bureau began conducting post-census
evaluations in 1940, the decennial census was less accurate than
its predecessor. ... the undercount rate of 1.8 percent in 1990 was
50 percent greater than the rate had been in 1980.'' United States
Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Report to the
Congress _ The Plan for Census 2000, (revised August 1997).
Specifically, the bureau reports that children, renters
(particularly in rural areas), and racial and ethnic minorities
were significantly undercounted. Among those the 1990 census missed
were 4.4 percent of African-Americans, 5.0 percent of Hispanics,
and 12.2 percent of American Indians living on reservations, but
only 0.7 percent of non-Hispanic whites. This undercounting of
certain groups relative to others, known as the ``differential
undercount,'' raises the possibility of Congressional
malapportionment, as jurisdictions with large numbers of
undercounted persons may have a greater share of the total
population than the census figures suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about problems with the 1990 Census, Congress passed
the Decennial Census Improvement Act of 1991, which directed the
National Academy of Sciences to study ``the means by which the
Government could achieve the most accurate population count
possible,'' including consideration of ``the appropriateness of
using sampling methods in combination with basic data-collection
techniques.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Statistical sampling is best understood as using information
derived from a portion of a population to infer information on the
population as a whole. The Bureau intends to use sampling in three
different phases of the 2000 Census. ...
</P>
<P>
   Motion for Summary Judgment
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The interpretation of two provisions of the Census Act, sections
141(a) and 195, is ultimately determinative as to whether
statistical adjustment to the initial headcount is permissible or
proscribed. These provisions were last amended in 1976, and the
resolution of this dispute depends upon the substantive effect of
the amendments. Plaintiff contends that while the 1976 amendments
encourage, if not require, the extensive use of sampling to collect
the myriad of general demographic information that the Bureau is
obliged to compile under the Census Act _ from occupational to
educational to income _ they do not permit the use of statistical
sampling to determine population for purposes of apportionment.
Defendants allege that Congress's grant of authority to use
sampling techniques extends to the apportionment enumeration. Other
courts that have addressed these two sections and the effect of the
1976 amendments have rejected the view that the Census Act
prohibits statistical sampling. For the following reasons, the
court must disagree.
</P>
<P>
   Section 195 of the Census Act
</P>
<P>
   Amended section 195 provides: Except for the determination of
population for purposes of apportionment of Representatives in
Congress among the several States, the Secretary shall, if he
considers it feasible, authorize the use of the statistical method
known as ``sampling'' in carrying out the provisions of this title.
...
</P>
<P>
   Defendants note that the 1976 amendments to section 195 altered
the call for non-apportionment use of statistical sampling methods
from ``may,'' which is an authorization, to ``shall,'' which is a
mandate. Defendants argue that an exception from a mandate is not a
prohibition in the area covered by the exception; instead,ea
covered by the exception is discretionary.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate defendants' interpretation of how this sentence
structure operates, consider the directive, ``Except for Mary, all
children at the party shall be served cake.'' That all children
other than Mary must be served cake is beyond dispute. However,
that mandate does not affirmatively prohibit the host from serving
cake to Mary. The decision as to whether to serve cake to Mary is,
by defendants' understanding of the instruction, a matter left to
the host's discretion. Applthe instant case, defendants
claim that with respect to apportionment, current section 195
commits the decision to use sampling to the discretion of the
Secretary. ...
</P>
<P>
   Though defendants' interpretation of the except/shall sentence
structure is proper in some instances, the court finds it to be
strained and incorrect when applied to amended section 195. ... In
the party hypothetical, one would expect that the person who issued
the directive ``except for Mary, all children at the party shall be
served cake'' would be quite surprised to learn that Mary had been
served cake. ...
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Consider the directive ``except for my grandmother's wedding
dress, you shall take the contents of my closet to the cleaners.''
It is far more likely that the granddaughter would be upset if the
recipient of her directive were to take the wedding dress to the
cleaners and subsequently argue that she had left this decision to
his discretion. The reason for this result, as contrasted with the
cake example, is because of our background knowledge concerning
wedding dresses: We know that they are extraordinarily fragile and
of deep sentimental value to family members. We therefore would not
expect that the decision to take a dress to the cleaners would be
purely discretionary.
</P>
<P>
   The apportionment of Congressional representatives among the
states is the wedding dress in the closet. ... The apportionment
function is, after all, the ``sole constitutional purpose of the
decennial enumeration.'' The manner in which it is conducted may
impact not only the distribution of representatives among the
states, but also the balance of political power within the House.
And, the apportionment has a direct effect upon the Presidency as
well, as the number of electors in the electoral college is ``equal
to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the
State may be entitled in the Congress.'' That the Congressional
apportionment function merits particularized treatment is best
demonstrated by the fact that when Congress first authorized the
use of sampling in 1957, that function was expressly excepted.
Having been completely explicit then, it is hard to believe that
Congress decided to rely upon subtle shifts in language to direct
the opposite in 1976. ...
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the court agrees with plaintiff's assertion that
``[d)efendants' argument that Congress eliminated a 200-year-old
prohibition against the use of statistical estimation techniques in
the constitutional census by way of a permissive negative inference
from an exception to a statutory mandate is wholly implausible.''
...
</P>
<P>
   It is a cardinal principle of statutory interpretation that
dramatic departures from past practices should not be read into
statutes without a definitive signal from Congress. ... Perhaps the
most eloquent statement of this concept comes from then-Justice
Rehnquist, writing in dissent in Harrison v. PPG Industries, ``In a
case where the construction of legislative language such as this
makes so sweeping and so relatively unorthodox a change as that
made here, I think judges as well as detectives may take into
consideration the fact that a watchdog did not bark in the night.''
(quoted in Chisom) Despite defendants' characterization of the
force of the legislative history, and the characterization of at
least one reviewing court, the court finds no indication that the
watchdog barked in the night. ...
</P>
<P>
   Congress was issuing a much stronger directive to the Department
of Commerce to employ sampling methodologies in most aspects of its
Title 13 data gathering responsibilities. However, Congress's
explicit directive again includes that ubiquitous qualifier _
``except in the apportionment of the U.S. House of
Representatives.'' The inclusion of this ``except'' language must
be read to mean that one area was affirmatively carved out from the
general desire to augment the use of sampling _ the area of the
Congressional apportionment enumeration. The second sentence of the
excerpted language is even more damaging to defendants' argument,
as it states that the only difference between the old and the new
section 195 is a reduction in the Secretary's discretion to use
sampling, not a categorical creation of discretion in an area in
which he previously had none.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of the legislature's bark is all the more compelling
when one considers what the watchdog is guarding. ... The House of
Representatives' apparent lack of interest in a statutory
modification that goes to the fundamental matter of its composition
cannot be ignored by the court.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, this court agrees with plaintiff's contention that
``[i)t borders on the absurd that Congress would enact such a
momentous change in such an oblique fashion.'' Had Congress wished
to authorize sampling techniques employed in the apportionment
enumeration, it could have done so quite simply by either: a)
deleting the ``except'' clause in its entirety; or, b) modifying
the clause so as to affirmatively declare what defendants claim to
be true by implication; that the Secretary may, in the exercise of
his discretion, use sampling techniques to supplement the inital
headcount enumeration to determine population for apportionment.
Because of the straightforward means available to Congress to
accomplish its purported goal, this court declines to ascribe to
Congress the ``surprisingly indirect route'' that defendants
advance. Section 141(a) of the Census Act
</P>
<P>
   Whatever strength there is to the claim that using statistical
sampling in the apportionment enumeration does not violate the
Census Act comes from the fact that section 195 must be read
together with the other provision addressing sampling
methodologies: section 141(a). Prior to 1976, section 141(a) did
not address sampling procedures. The post-1976 version states, in
relevant part: The Secretary shall, in the year 1980 and every 10
years thereafter, take a decennial census of population ... in such
form and content as he may determine, including the use of sampling
procedures and special surveys (emphasis added).
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that section 141(a), which standing alone appears
to permit statistical sampling in Congressional apportionment, and
section 195, which indisputably proscribes the same, conflict, the
rules of statutory construction dictate the resolution. The more
specific provision controls the general. ...
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, while 141 permits sampling techniques and surveys
in the conduct of the decennial census, that general grant is
subject to the more specific ``Use of Sampling'' directive in 195,
which, as explained above, explicitly proscribes the use of
sampling for apportioning representatives among the states. ...
</P>
<P>
   Reading section 141(a) and section 195 together, and considering
the plain text, legislative history and other tools of statutory
construction, this court finds that the use of statistical sampling
to determine the population for purposes of the apportionment of
representatives in Congress among the states violates the Census
Act. ...
</P>
<P>
   Because this court finds that the Census Act prohibits the use
of statistical sampling to determine the population for the purpose
of apportionment of representatives among the states, there is no
need to reach the constitutional questions presented. &QL;
