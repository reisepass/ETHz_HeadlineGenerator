   WASHINGTON _ Having lost two decisions in the lower courts,
Clinton administration officials and advocates of statistical
sampling in the 2000 census have begun to think about ways to use a
modified form of the controversial methodology even if they do not
prevail in the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The officials and proponents of the method say recent rulings by
special federal courts in Virginia and the District of Columbia
that held sampling to be illegal only covered using the method to
determine population counts for the allocation of seats among the
states in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Supreme Court agrees with those rulings, officials
said they would still be free _ some say required _ to use the
method to determine how federal money is allocated and to establish
population counts that are provided to states for drawing
boundaries for congressional, state and local legislative
districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're really saying is that the court cases and the
arguments by the opponents of the census 2000 plan have been very
limited to apportionment,'' said Robert Shapiro, Undersecretary of
the Commerce Department's Economic Statistics Administration, the
agency that oversees the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Special three-judge panels ruled this summer that the Census
Bureau's plans to use statistical sampling to augment the 2000
census violated the Census Act of 1976. That act stated that
``except for the determination of population for purposes of
apportionment of representatives in Congress among the several
states,'' the Secretary of Commerce shall use statistical sampling
in conducting the census.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers representing proponents of sampling note that
because the statute uses the term ``shall,'' the law requires the
Census Bureau to use sampling to help determine the population for
the allocation of federal funds and for use in drawing lines for
election districts. That mandate would remain in force even if the
Supreme Court affirms the decisions that sampling used for
apportioning congressional seats among the states is illegal, the
lawyers say.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, Shapiro said he fully expected the
Supreme Court to rule that sampling was indeed legal. He also
stressed that any decision about what the administration would do
if the court upheld the lower courts would be made in consultation
with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official familiar with the census issue said
Tuesday that the White House had asked the Office of Management and
Budget for a legal opinion of whether the president already has the
authority to order that sampling be used for determining the
population for the allocation of federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   Republican opponents of sampling said Tuesday that they would
never agree to finance a census count that allowed the sampling
method to be used for the drawing of election districts. ``It's a
non-starter,'' said Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House
Subcommittee on the Census.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that a court decision invalidating sampling would be
limited to apportionment of congressional seats adds a new wrinkle
to what has become a highly complex and partisan battle over the
next census.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody ever really care too much about the federal funding
aspect,'' said Clark Bensen, president of Polydata, a Republican
demographic research company. ``To the extent that the politicians
get excited about the census, they don't get excited about
apportionment which might shift one or maybe two seats to different
states. They get excited because of redistricting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau wants to use sampling to estimate portions of
the population, like blacks in cities and in rural parts of the
Southeast and Hispanics in the Southwest and California, that tend
to be missed by the traditional means of conducting the census.
</P>
<P>
   These groups tend to live in areas that are overwhelmingly
Democratic. Thus counting more of them could give the Democrats an
advantage when lines for congressional and state and local election
districts are drawn.
