   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans questioned the quality of
work produced by the Census Bureau in a count that is ahead of
schedule and said the shortcomings may affect the accuracy of the
raw data collected for Census 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House Government Reform
Committee's census panel, said some Census Bureau employees may
have been pressured by performance-based incentives while others
took procedural shortcuts in gathering information.
</P>
<P>
   Census-takers are finishing a 10-week operation of gathering
information from homes that did not return a questionnaire. Census
officials said the incentive program was not based on how fast
Census 2000 data was collected, but other statistical and
administrative tasks performed by the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Census director Kenneth Prewitt said he was confident in the
quality of work being produced and assured that quality-control
procedures ferreted out inaccurate information. Census officials
highlighted one Census office in Hialeah, Fla. where enumerators
are now re-interviewing over 11,000 households after a procedural
discrepancy was found.
</P>
<P>
   ''While we are pleased with progress thus far, there remain
several operations that will improve what already is a good
census,'' Prewitt said. ''I have said numerous times that any
national statistic -- including the census count -- is an estimate of
the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt also said, however, that the most accurate estimate uses
a statistical method known as ''sampling,'' in which the results of
a separate, random sample of 314,000 households will be used to
adjust the raw population count from Census 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of sampling say it helps account for segments of the
population undercounted in prior counts, including minorities, the
poor, and inner-city residents -- groups that tend to vote
Democratic. Many Republicans in Congress oppose the sampling
technique, and favor an actual head count. GOP leaders fear using
the sampled numbers could lead to reshaped districts with higher
concentrations of Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court last year said the reapportionment of House
seats must be based on raw, non-sampled data. However, it left open
the option for states to use statistically adjusted numbers for
purposes of redrawing political boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing Thursday, Republicans voiced concern that Census
officials were rushing through the count. With about two weeks left
to a self-imposed deadline, the Census Bureau has reached over 99
percent of the country's 120 million households.
</P>
<P>
   ''I get the feeling that if they were slow, (Republicans) would
call it a failed census. Now, since it's moving quickly, you're
calling it a rushed census,'' countered Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New
York, ranking member of the subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney was also angered by the House's proposed budget for the
Census Bureau next fiscal year. Dan DuBray, spokesman for Rep.
Harold Rogers, R-Ky., chairman of the House Appropriations
subcommittee overseeing Census Bureau funding, said spending being
considered is $48.3 million less than the $719 million the Clinton
administration requested.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau got $4.7 billion for fiscal 2000, but that
included $4.4 billion for this year's census. The cut ''might pose
a serious threat to getting corrected data released,'' Maloney
said.
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau spokesman Steve Jost said the cut could hamper the
agency's collection of economic data, including the Consumer Price
Index and unemployment figures.
</P>
<P>
   Subcommittee Republicans on Thursday also criticized the Justice
Department's response Monday to a lawsuit filed by Virginia over
sampled data. Justice asked the U.S. District Court for the
District of Columbia to dismiss or delay proceedings in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia wants the court to allow the state to use raw Census
2000 numbers for drawing new congressional districts without first
going to the Justice Department for approval, since the state falls
under Federal Voting Rights regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The case is being watched closely by supporters and opponents of
sampling as a benchmark in determining the constitutionality of
sampled data.
