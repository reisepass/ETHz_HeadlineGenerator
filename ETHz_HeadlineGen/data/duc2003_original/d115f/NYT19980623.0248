   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Tuesday nominated New York
social scientist Kenneth Prewitt to head the Census Bureau, an
agency mired in a political and legal controversy as it tries to
get an accurate reading for the year 2000 population count.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy centers around the bureau's proposal to use a
statistical accounting method in addition to its standard head
count in an effort to include U.S. citizens _ mostly minorities _
who either do not receive or fail to complete a survey that will be
sent to every U.S. household in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans, who maintain a head count is the only
way the Constitution allows the census to be taken, are leery of
allowing the Clinton administration to use statistical sampling to
estimate the number of minorities, a traditionally strong voting
bloc for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP-dominated House has sued the Census Bureau to block the
sampling method, arguing that the Constitution's call for an
``actual enumeration'' of the U.S. population requires a head count
and prohibits other calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said statistical sampling yields the most accurate
results by accounting for people census takers might miss. Without
the use of statistics, the 2000 Census might result in another
inaccurate count, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau has said it failed to count 8 million people,
mostly minorities and children, in the 1990 survey.
</P>
<P>
   An accurate count is vital because the government uses census
data in deciding how to distribute federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the high stakes, it is unfortunate that Census 2000 has
become prey to partisan disagreements,'' Prewitt said at a news
conference announcing his nomination. ``These differences place
Census 2000 at risk by delaying the bureau's preparation for the
enormously complex task of accurately counting the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   A panel of three federal judges this month heard arguments for
and against the constitutionality of statistical sampling from
lawyers for the Census Bureau and House, respectively. The judges
have yet to rule, and whatever they decide will likely be appealed
to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt, 62, said he has used statistical sampling in collecting
data for the New York-based Social Science Research Council, of
which he is president, and in his five years as director of the
National Opinion Research Center in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientific sampling is used widely,'' Prewitt said.
``Sampling, if properly used, can contribute to a more accurate
census.''
</P>
<P>
   If Congress or the courts prohibit the use of statistical
sampling, Prewitt said he would still press ahead to ``conduct the
most accurate and cost-effective census possible.'' Prewitt, whose
nomination still must be confirmed by the Senate, also pledged to
work closely with Congress to ensure the bureau remains a
``nonpartisan agency obligated by law and guided by professional
traditions'' to present objective data at a reasonable cost.

   Commerce Secretary William Daley, in whose department the bureau
resides, also defended statistical sampling as a way to achieve an
accurate count of the U.S. population. Daley said past surveys that
relied solely on head counts yielded inaccurate results to the
misfortune of all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Equality before the law and one person, one vote are at
stake,'' Daley said in introducing Prewitt. ``We are proud of the
scientific plan developed by the professionals at the Census
Bureau.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton defended the plan to use statistical sampling
during his visit to Houston this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should all want the most accurate method,'' Clinton said in
the Hispanic enclave of Magnolia Park in east Houston. ``An
inaccurate census distorts our understanding of the needs of our
people, and in many respects, therefore, it diminishes the quality
of life not only for them, but for all the rest of us as well.''
