   In one of the first cases of an Internet company buying its
traditional competitor, the electronic auction service Ebay Inc.
agreed Monday to acquire Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield Auctioneers
Corp., San Francisco's largest auction house, for $260 million in
stock.
   Ebay has been one of the most explosive growth companies on the
Internet, with a service that lets both individuals and businesses
auction off everything from stuffed animals to rare stamps. It also
is one of the few profitable Internet concerns. On Monday, Ebay
said it earned $5.9 million in the first quarter, up tenfold from a
year earlier.
   Investors have become so enamored of the company that it
currently has a market value of $26 billion, giving it the ability
to make acquisitions using its stock with little dilution to its
existing shareholders.
   Still, the deal represented a huge payoff for the privately held
Butterfield, which had been set to go public this week at $14 to
$16 a share. Ebay has offered to pay nearly $50 a share.
   Margaret Whitman, chief executive of Ebay, said the company was
buying Butterfield to expand from small items into those priced
from $500 to $5,000.
   ``What Ebay did for garage sales and collectibles we now want to
do for higher-end items,'' she said. ``We can grow the market and
make it a lot more efficient.''
   Butterfield, which was founded in 1865, says it is the
third-largest auction house in the country, after Sotheby's
Holdings Inc. and the Christie's International PLC unit of the
French holding company Artemis. It specializes in more moderately
priced art, collectibles and furniture. It has been involved in a
number of high-profile auctions, like one involving items belonging
to O.J. Simpson.
   Butterfield also has a staff of curators who can provide
services, like appraisals, that Ebay currently does not offer.
   Two weeks ago, Ebay and Butterfield announced an agreement to
set up jointly a new auction site for art and collectibles. Just
after the announcement, while Butterfield's management was meeting
with potential investors to promote its planned stock offering,
Ebay offered to buy the company.
   ``This industry is changing drastically,'' said John Gallo,
Butterfield's president. ``We need technology, we need marketing
and we need customer service. Ebay brings us all three.''
   In particular, Gallo said, Ebay can help the company reach
customers that no auction house does. ``If you take the top 10
auctioneering firms in the world, they have a total customer base
of under 500,000 people,'' he said. ``Ebay has 2.4 million buyers
and 6.5 million users.''
   At first, the companies plan to proceed largely as they would
have under their earlier joint venture. They say they will create a
site, called Internationalgallery.com, that will let people watch
live audio and video broadcasts from participating auction houses
and submit bids to them. It will also offer items in online-only
auctions, but unlike Ebay's regular auctions, these will guarantee
the authenticity of the items.
   Sellers pay a fee of 5 percent to 10 percent of the purchase
price for these auctions. That is more than the 2 percent to 5
percent charged by Ebay, but far less than the fees involved in a
traditional auction, where the seller pays a fee of 10 percent to
25 percent and the buyer also pays a ``buyers premium'' of 10
percent to 15 percent.
   The online auctions, Gallo said, can have lower fees because
they are vastly more efficient than traditional auctions. ``The
dealer doesn't have to move the painting from the wall _ they just
catalog the item and send us a photograph,'' he said.
   Jerry Kaplan, the chief executive of Onsale Inc., an Internet
company that auctions off surplus computer goods, said: ``It looks
like a great move for Ebay. They can take resources being
underutilized in a land-based auction company and offer them to a
larger audience.''
   Ebay has competition from all sides. Amazon.com, the largest
online store, has just opened an auction service. Meanwhile, both
Sotheby's and Christie's say they are developing online auctions of
their own.
   None of these moves has yet to slow Ebay's growth. Some $541
million in goods were sold on Ebay's site in the last quarter, up
76 percent from the fourth quarter of 1998. The number of
registered users increased 75 percent, to 3.6 million.
   Revenue was $34 million, up 469 percent from a year earlier. The
company's gross profit margin was 85 percent, down from 89 percent
a year ago.
   Ms. Whitman cautioned that unlike traditional retailers that do
best during the Christmas months, Ebay has its strongest quarter in
its first quarter. ``The winter months are far more robust, because
our buyers and sellers are not outside and people are selling a lot
of their Christmas gifts,'' she said.
