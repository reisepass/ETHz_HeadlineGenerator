   A plan by New England's two largest banks to introduce a maximum
$1 ATM surcharge on customers from other banks and not raise the
fee for two years may violate antitrust laws, the state attorney
general's office said Friday.
   ``In antitrust laws, agreements among competitors to set maximum
fees have been held illegal,'' said Barbara Anthony, chief of the
Public Protection Bureau at Massachusetts Attorney General Scott
Harshbarger's office. ``This office is concerned about certain
antitrust issues raised by this agreement between the two banks and
is reviewing and examining the matter.''
   Anthony, whose bureau handles antitrust issues, said officials
would meet with banks next week to discuss the issue.
   Fleet Financial Group, Inc. and BankBoston Corp., which own
two-thirds of all automated teller machines in Massachusetts, said
on Thursday they would adhere to a proposal by the 210-member
Massachusetts Bankers Association to charge non-customers a maximum
$1 surcharge per ATM transaction over two years.
   The move by the two Boston-based banks, which hold 40 percent of
all deposits in the state, was a compromise designed to appease
consumer advocates and lawmakers who have been urging legislators
to ban ATM surcharges outright.
   Massachusetts Bankers Association executive vice president Kevin
F. Kiley said the ATM surcharge plan was not a formal agreement but
rather a set of voluntary guidelines _ a distinction he said meant
the surcharge does not violate antitrust laws. A banking lawyer who
declined to be identified echoed that thought. Fleet and BankBoston
officials declined to comment.
   Critics of ATM surcharges contend the fees will hurt small banks
and drive their customers into the arms of larger banks, which have
more ATMs. A $1 surcharge covering 3,200 ATMs in Massachusetts
processing an average 7,000 transactions a month _ 25 percent of
them for customers from banks other than those which own the ATMS _
would cost consumers $60 million a year, according to the
Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group.
   The banks say non-clients should have to pay for the service.
   BankBoston already charges its own customers a $2 dollar fee
each time they use another bank's ATM, but it has not decided if or
when it will levy surcharges on customers at its New Hampshire,
Connecticut, and Rhode Island branches. Fleet charges non-customers
using its ATM machines a $1 fee in four states outside
Massachusetts. The two banks have said they may forge agreements
allowing other banks to pay the fee directly rather than levy it on
non-customers who use BankBoston or Fleet ATMs.
   The State Senate passed a bill last year preventing banks from
charging non-customers any fees for using their ATMS, but the House
has yet to vote on the matter. House Speaker Thomas Finneran
opposes the bill.
