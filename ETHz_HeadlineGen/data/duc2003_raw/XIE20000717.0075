DHAKA, July 17 (Xinhua -- Bangladesh and India Monday kicked
off border talks in Chittagong, the largest port city in the
country, in the wake of a series of bloody border clashes which
left five people dead in both sides during the last week.
Informed sources told Xinhua that the two sides had two rounds
of talks on the first day of a three-day high-level border
conference between the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) and the Indian
Border Security Force (BSF).
Officials of the BDR, the border guard of Bangladesh, said the
talks were going on smoothly.
"Recent frontier fights between the two border security forces
and intrusion by Indians into Bangladesh territories are among the
issues discussed at the talks," an BDR official said.
Besides intrusion by the BSF, Indian nationals and law
enforcers, the long-drawn agenda for the border coordination
conference also include matters relating to disputed lands of
Nayagram and Muhurirchar, and firing and casualties in border
areas.
Repair and maintenance of border pillars, demarcation of
disputed lands, woman and child trafficking and smuggling will
also come for discussion, the BDR sources said.
During last week, the border guards of Bangladesh and India
fought a series of battles in two frontiers, Northeastern Sylet
and Northwestern Kurigram, where three Bangladeshi civilians were
killed. India claimed its two BSF members were killed in the
border clashes.
One hundred Bangladeshi, including six BDR personnel, were shot
dead and 106 injured in incidents of firing by the BSF in border
areas in the last four and a half years, making the 4,156-
kilometer border between the two countries "one of the most
volatile international borders", according to the BDR sources.
The border killings have increased since early this year. In
the first six months, 22 Bangladeshis were killed in the
indiscriminate firing by the BSF in different frontiers.
