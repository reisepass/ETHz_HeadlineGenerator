BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- China today urged soldiers and
civilians to persist to the end in the struggle against the worst
flooding on several major rivers.
Flooding on the Yangtze and Songhua rivers evolved to new
historic disaster levels today, according to the State
Headquarters for Flood Control and Drought Relief.
"Soldiers and civilians fighting floods on the middle and lower
reaches of the Yangtze and in the Songhua River Valley are now
facing new serious challenges," a headquarters spokesman said.
Affected by the sixth flood crest of the Yangtze River and the
surging waters in Dongting Lake, the water level of the Yangtze
between Lianhuatang in Yueyang of central Hunan Province and
Wuhan, capital of central Hubei Province, hit this year's high
today.
The Yangtze's water level measured at Lianhuatang rose to 35.79
meters at 8 p.m. today, up 0.05 meters from Wednesday.
The level of Dongting Lake measured at Chenglingji also reached
35.92 meters, up 0.11 meters from Wednesday, or 0.61 meters higher
than the previous all-time high.
Meanwhile, in northeast China, the flood crest of the Songhua
River is passing through Harbin, capital of Heilongjiang
Province. The water level at Harbin reached 120.78 meters at 8
p.m. today, 0.73 meters higher than the previous historic
high. The water flow of 17,300 cubic meters is also an all-time
high.
A headquarters expert said that some three million soldiers and
civilians are fighting floods along the Yangtze's major
embankments on the middle and lower reaches. In northeast China,
the number of flood-control people exceeds 900,000.
Heavy rains are expected in part of the Yangtze River Valley in
the days ahead, while the Songhua River Valley in the northeast is
undergoing a season of torrential rains, according to official
forecasts.
"The bad weather in the two flooding areas will further
exacerbate the situation," the expert said, urging flood-control
soldiers and civilians to remain on high alert.
"The safety of life and property of people on the middle and
lower reaches of the Yangtze River and of people in the
river-bound areas in northeast China, together with the
achievements of 20 years of reforms and opening-up, now hinge on
our struggle with floods," he said.
