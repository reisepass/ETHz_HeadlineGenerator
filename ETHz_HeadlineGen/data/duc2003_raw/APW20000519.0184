   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Partisan bickering in Congress resurfaced
Friday over Census 2000 and the use of sampling, a statistical
method that could affect the way Congressional and state
legislative district boundaries are redrawn next year.
   At a hearing of the House Government Reform Committee's census
panel, Democrats said sampling would help account for those people
who did not, or refused, to return a census form. Republicans
charged that using the statistical method could introduce more
error into the national population count, adding people who do not
exist while deleting real people who filled out a form.
   The Census Bureau favors sampling. In the last count in 1990,
Census officials estimated a net undercount of 1.6 percent of the
population. Many of those undercounted were minorities or
inner-city residents who tend to vote Democrat.
   Redistricting will be based on Census 2000 results and in
general, the GOP opposes sampling, fearing it could redraw
political lines to their disadvantage.
   For now, the Census Bureau intends to release both sampled and
non-sampled population figures. A 1999 Supreme Court decision
required reapportionment of Congressional seats to be based on
unadjusted data. States will have the option of using either set of
numbers for redistricting.
   ''I have said previously that the Census Bureau currently
expects that the corrected numbers using (sampling) will be the
more accurate numbers,'' Census director Kenneth Prewitt told the
subcommittee on Friday. ''If the Census Bureau does not have
confidence in the (sampled) results, we will not release it.''
   The sampled data will be based on the Census Bureau's Accuracy
and Coverage Evaluation of 314,000 households. At-home visits for
the evaluation begin in June.
   By law, the Secretary of Commerce in the next president's
administration has the option of telling the Census Bureau not to
release the sampled results. Commerce oversees the Census Bureau.
   The presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, Vice
President Al Gore, supports sampling; his GOP counterpart, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, has said he favors an ''actual count.''
   As in 1990, more lawsuits are expected over the issue once
census results roll out, which could further test the
constitutionality of using sampled numbers.
   Subcommittee chairman Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., said his
opposition goes beyond the political consequences. It was not until
two years after the 1990 census that a review of sampling
procedures revealed there were errors, he said.
   ''Once states draw their district lines, you can't come back a
year later and say 'Sorry. We made a mistake,''' Miller said.
   He also questioned whether the Census Bureau would have enough
time to accurately produce the sampled data. Unadjusted population
figures, are due to President Clinton by Dec. 31. Sampled numbers
are due to be released in groups of roughly 10 states per week
beginning in March 2001.
   ''I believe that the 2000 census may well be the best, fairest
and most accurate census ever,'' countered Rep. Carolyn Maloney of
New York, the subcommittee's ranking Democrat.
   ''Those who oppose the use of modern scientific methods in the
census would ensure the millions of people missed in the census are
left out permanently, and the millions of people counted twice are
forever kept in,'' she added. ''That is fundamentally unfair and
must stop.''
   On a related note, Prewitt said half of the 42 million
households which did not return a census form had now been
contacted in the current phase of the census. Census-takers will
try to reach the other half by early July.
