	NEW YORK (AP) -- Under the new bowl coalition format that crowned  
a clear-cut national champion, more people were expected to watch 
the 1999 Fiesta Bowl title game. That didn't happen. 
	Tennessee's national championship victory in the Fiesta Bowl was  
watched in more than 17 million homes, for a 17.2 national rating. 
Even though two games had national title implications last year, 
the Rose Bowl still managed a higher (17.6) rating. 
	However, the 1998 Rose Bowl featured Michigan winning a  
last-second thriller over Washington State while the Orange Bowl 
pitted Nebraska against Tennessee and grabbed a 13.3 rating. 
	The Wolverines and Cornhuskers finished the season with a share  
of the national championship. 
	Monday's contest was a yawner for much of the game, until the  
final minutes when Florida State cut the deficit to seven points. 
	``I expected the Fiesta Bowl would do a pretty good number, but  
I thought it would be better than that,'' said ABC analyst Todd 
Blackledge, who worked the Fiesta Bowl on Monday night. ``One of 
the factors may have been that both teams were from the southeast, 
so it was kind of a regional game.'' 
	Under the new format, four bowl games comprise the Bowl  
Championship Series -- Fiesta, Rose, Orange and Sugar. 
	The remaining three bowls actually fared better than last  
season's No. 2, 3 and 4 games. 
	What was even more impressive was that it was done without top  
draws Notre Dame, Michigan and Penn State. 
	``The BCS has had a positive impact on TV ratings,'' ABC  
spokesman Mark Mandel said. ``But the bigger picture of all of this 
is that it crowned a national champion.'' 
	This season's Rose Bowl, a shootout won by Wisconsin over UCLA,  
posted a 13.6 rating, which was 2 percent higher than the 1998 
Orange Bowl. 
	The 1999 Sugar Bowl, in which Ohio State won easily over Texas  
A&AMP;M, had a 11.5 rating -- an increase of 3 percent from last year's 
game between Ohio State and Florida State. 
	The Orange Bowl this year was the lowest-rated of the BCS bowls,  
a 8.4 rating. That was still well ahead of the either the Cotton 
(6.2) or Fiesta (5.8) in 1998.
