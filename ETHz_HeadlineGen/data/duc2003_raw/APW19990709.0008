	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With initial evidence-gathering completed,  
Justice Department officials have begun weighing whether to seek 
indictments of anyone over the scandal surrounding Salt Lake City's 
successful effort to win the 2002 Winter Olympics, a law 
enforcement official said Thursday. 
	Federal prosecutors in Salt Lake City and supervisors in the  
fraud section of the department's criminal division here are going 
over the witness interviews and the documents and records gathered 
since the probe got under way early this year to see if there is 
enough evidence to support federal criminal charges, according to 
the official, who requested anonymity. 
	No decision is imminent; the review may take some time, the  
official said. Indeed, superiors here could order the six Justice 
lawyers and FBI agents who work full time on the case in Salt Lake 
City to go back to gather more evidence. Or they could draft a 
prosecution memorandum for top-level approval and ask the federal 
grand jury in Salt Lake City to return indictments. 
	It could not be learned how many indictments might be  
considered, although some published reports have put the number at 
two or more. 
	Investigators have looked for evidence against both alleged  
bribers in Salt Lake City and bribe-takers on the International 
Olympic Committee, which selects the sites for the games. 
	The IOC has said Salt Lake City's 2002 bid committee spent  
$800,000 on 14 IOC members, including travel expenses and 
entertainment, gifts, scholarships for their children and cash 
payments. 
	At least four IOC members were reportedly questioned by the FBI  
in May when they attended a Coordination Commission meeting in Salt 
Lake. 
	Ten IOC members either resigned or were expelled for receiving  
cash and other improper inducements from Salt Lake bidders. The two 
top Salt Lake bid and organizing committee officials lost their 
jobs in the scandal. 
	Mail and wire fraud, conspiracy and travel in aid of  
racketeering are among the charges that federal investigators 
looked into because they saw the case as one of commercial bribery, 
rather than the more familiar government variety, Justice officials 
have said. 
	While the government usually lets private parties settle  
commercial bribery cases through civil lawsuits, federal charges 
are possible when a federal interest is involved, like the 
integrity of the Olympic games. 
	The racketeering law -- known as ITAR, for interstate travel in  
aid of racketeering -- prohibits interstate and foreign travel to 
further federal or state crimes like bribery and extortion or to 
distribute their illicit proceeds. It could be used against both 
bribe givers and takers. 
	Bribe takers also might face extortion charges, depending on the  
evidence gathered. 
	Investigators also have looked at whether the Salt Lake City  
panel violated its tax-exempt status and whether recipients failed 
to pay any U.S. taxes due on payments. And they looked at possible 
gun charges over the shipment out of the country of rifles, pistols 
and other weapons given as gifts to IOC members. 
	Justice officials familiar with the Foreign Corrupt Practices  
Act were involved in the investigation, but that act applies only 
to bribes paid by U.S. citizens to foreign officials to influence 
actions of their governments. Some foreign officials serve on the 
Olympic Committee, but it is a private organization. 
	Finally, prosecutors must still weigh whether federal or state  
charges would be the most likely to succeed, reach the largest 
number of potentially guilty parties and provide the most 
appropriate penalties.
