PRAGUE, March 5 (Xinhua) -- NATO General Secretary Javier
Solana Thursday expressed satisfaction over preparations the
Czech Republic is making to join NATO. He reiterated that the
alliance's expansion will not be "frozen."
Solana made the remark during a four-day visit to the Czech
Republic and Slovak.
He praised efforts made by the Czech Republic to integrate
its military with NATO and called on the two sides to continue
deepening ties.
While visiting the country, Solana said the Czech Republic,
Poland and Hungary will become full NATO members in April 1999, a
date that will coincide with the 50th anniversary of the alliance.
He added that NATO will not deploy nuclear weapons in these
new member countries.
In Slovak, the NATO chief declined to give a timetable as to
when the country would join the bloc. He did reassure Slovak
authorities that the policy set at the Madrid summit on expansion
would remain in effect.
