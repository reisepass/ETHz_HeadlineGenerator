	TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- The Kansas Board of Education has approved  
new standards for teaching science in public schools that critics 
say strips evolution from its accepted place at the center of 
biological studies. 
	Republican Gov. Bill Graves called the board's action on  
Wednesday ``a terrible, tragic, embarrassing solution to a problem 
that didn't exist.'' 
	The standards are general guidelines for local school boards,  
which may still decide to teach evolution. But many fear students 
won't be evaluated on evolution in state assessment tests. 
	``I can't believe we would test anything that's optional,'' said  
board member Janet Waugh of Kansas City, who voted against the new 
standards. 
	The new standards delete references to so-called  
``macroevolution'' -- the process of change from one species to 
another -- but include references to ``microevolution,'' or changes 
within species. They also mention natural selection, the idea that 
advantageous traits increase in a population over time. 
	However, the standards do not contain language recommended by  
science educators that called evolution by natural selection ``a 
broad, unifying theoretical framework in biology.'' 
	The issue of evolution education continues to raise passions in  
American schools more than 70 years after teacher John Scopes was 
convicted of violating a Tennessee law against teaching it. 
	Evolution is the theory that all life evolved from common  
ancestors. Those opposed to it say it contradicts the biblical 
account of the creation of life, and they object to the idea that 
human life resulted from a lower life form. 
	More than a decade ago, the Supreme Court ruled that public  
schools cannot teach creationism, the theory that a divine being 
created the universe. Opponents of the new standards say 
conservatives are trying their only remaining tactic -- to limit the 
teaching of evolution. 
	Kansas is one of several states, including Arizona, Alabama,  
Illinois, New Mexico, Texas and Nebraska, where school boards 
recently have attempted to take evolution out of state science 
standards or de-emphasize evolutionary concepts. 
	Critics of the Kansas board's action worry it took a step toward  
permitting schools to teach creationists' view that the earth is 
only a few thousand of years old, based on the Bible's account. 
	Conservative board members said they wanted to make sure that  
schools teach sound science, arguing that evolution is a flawed 
theory that cannot be proven. 
	But Waugh and board member Bill Wagnon of Topeka, both  
Democrats, said the new standard will put Kansas students at a 
disadvantage with students from other states on college entrance 
exams. 
	``How can we allow our students to be tested on information that  
has never been presented to them?'' Waugh asked. 
	Last year, the National Academy of Sciences said evolution must  
be taught in public schools if children are to understand biology 
at all. 
	The organization issued a guidebook for teachers, parents and  
school administrators that asserted: ``There is no debate within 
the scientific community over whether evolution has occurred, and 
there is no evidence that evolution has not occurred.'' 
	The consequences of Wednesday's vote were not entirely clear  
even to the state's highest education administrator. 
	``I've got to go put the pieces back together before I can  
answer that,'' said Education Commissioner Andy Tompkins after the 
board's 6-4 vote.
