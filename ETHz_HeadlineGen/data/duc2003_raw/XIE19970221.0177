OTTAWA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien said today that he supports the Czech Republic's bid to
join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
Canada also supports NATO membership applications by the other
five members of the now defunct Warsaw Pact, Chretien said while
accompanying Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus to the Canadian
Parliament.
The other five countries bidding for NATO membership are
Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania and Slovakia.
"For me, I would be in favor of the six countries but I don't
think there will be six, even if it were my wish," Chretien
said. "But I know the Czech Republic is always at the top of the
list."
Canada and the United States support NATO's eastward expansion
plans, but Russia strongly opposes the move.
Klaus, leading a delegation of business people, arrived in
Ottawa today for a three-day visit aimed mainly at expanding trade
and investment between the two countries.
So far, Canada has invested about 110 million U.S. dollars in
the Czech Republic. Bilateral trade reached some 118 million
dollars in 1996, up from 102 million the previous year.
