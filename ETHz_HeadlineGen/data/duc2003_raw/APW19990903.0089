	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno today denied that  
recent revelations about the FBI's use of tear gas during the 1993 
Branch Davidian siege had strained her relations with FBI Director 
Louis Freeh. This is no time to ``play one off against the other,'' 
she said. 
	At her weekly news conference, Reno said she will find a person  
who is free of ``conflicts of interest and will be well-received'' 
to head an independent investigation into why it took the FBI six 
years to acknowledge its use of the pyrotechnic tear-gas canisters. 
	``What I hope will happen is that we will be able to agree on a  
mandate that gives them full authority to pursue any unanswered 
question,'' the attorney general said, declining to identify the 
candidate she is seeking to head the probe. 
	Reno and Freeh themselves have been under siege since the FBI's  
disclosure last week that a ``very limited number'' of incendiary 
tear-gas rounds were fired at a concrete outpost adjacent to the 
Davidians' compound on the final day of the 51-day standoff. That 
admission, and the FBI's production this week of previously 
undisclosed videotape evidence, came after six years of denials. 
	The assault on the complex near Waco, Texas, ended with cult  
leader David Koresh and some 80 followers dead -- some by fire, 
others by gunshot. Reno accepted full responsibility for the 
assault and federal officials have insisted that the fire was 
started by Koresh and his followers. 
	While confirming that she had ordered agents not to use  
incendiary devices during the tear-gas operation, Reno said all the 
evidence she has seen supports the view that federal agents did not 
start the fire. 
	``If the truth shows what I believe to be the case -- that we  
tried to set up something that would bring the people out and give 
them a chance to come out in a safe and orderly way -- and that it 
was their determination and their judgment and their actions that 
brought that fire upon them, then I would use the experience we 
have here and figure out what we can do for the future,'' she said. 
	Asked whether she would resign: ``If the truth shows I've done  
something wrong, then I will accept the consequences.'' 
	Reno said she hoped to identify the lead investigator as soon as  
possible, but didn't say when that would be. 
	``It has taken some time because I want to do it the right  
way,'' she said. 
	Reno also told reporters she is proceeding carefully because she  
wants to assure that the investigation ``has the confidence and 
faith of the American people.'' 
	Reno said she and Freeh often confer on difficult issues and  
sometimes disagree. 
	``Yeah, sometimes I call him and say, `Why did you do this?' or  
he will call and say, `If I were you, I'd do that.' That's the type 
of relationship we have,'' she said. 
	President Clinton is among those calling for an independent  
investigation of the Waco case. Clinton ``is deeply concerned that 
the attorney general appears to have been misled and may have been 
lied to'' about what went on at Waco, White House spokesman Jake 
Siewert said Thursday. 
	The FBI's admission last week that combustible tear gas was used  
provoked a furor on and off Capitol Hill. 
	In addition to the Reno-ordered probe, congressional hearings  
will be convened this fall and the House Judiciary Committee 
chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill, is pushing for a congressional 
commission in hopes that would avoid the bitter partisanship 
exhibited during earlier Waco hearings on Capitol Hill. 
	The infrared videotape made public Thursday, recorded from an  
FBI plane, runs from just before 6 a.m. to 8 a.m. on the final 
morning of the 51-day siege -- covering the period during which the 
FBI assault began. 
	That footage, which FBI officials said was recently discovered  
at the FBI Hostage Rescue Team's offices in Quantico, Va., was 
taken into custody Wednesday by federal marshals at Justice's 
instruction. The Hostage Rescue Team was in charge of operations 
during the siege. 
	Reno denied today that Justice's use of marshals to confiscate  
the evidence marked a public rebuke to the FBI -- a contention her 
own aides had made. ``I think it was everyone trying to figure out 
what the best way to do it was, and some people making some 
assumptions that weren't correct,'' she said. 
	A second videotape, which runs from 8 a.m. to 10:42 a.m.,  
surfaced Thursday; and FBI officials were taking steps to release 
it publicly as well. 
	Bureau officials had previously insisted in sworn affidavits  
that they didn't have any infrared video footage before 10:42 a.m. 
-- hours after the tear-gas assault began at 5:55 a.m. FBI spokesman 
Tron Brekke said the apparent discrepancy is ``a legitimate point 
for inquiry.'' 
	The early morning tape captured a radio transmission in which an  
FBI field commander granted permission for an agent to lob military 
incendiary tear-gas rounds at a concrete bunker 40 yards from the 
Davidians' compound. 
	``He can try it?'' asked the rescue team's supervisory special  
agent, Stephen P. McGavin, after saying that an agent could ``with 
relative safety'' use a vehicle as cover and fire military tear gas 
canisters into the bunker. 
	``Yeah, that's affirmative,'' answered Richard M. Rogers, the  
rescue team's assistant special agent in charge. 
	Brekke said bureau officials decided to release the video and a  
transcript because the action ``clearly demonstrates that we are 
interested in the facts concerning Waco to come out.'' 
	``It's in our interest,'' he added. ``Our credibility's been  
hurt.'' 
	The FBI said the conversation took place at 7:49 a.m. -- nearly  
two hours after the tear-gas assault began but hours before flames 
began racing through the Davidians' wooden home at 12:07 p.m.
