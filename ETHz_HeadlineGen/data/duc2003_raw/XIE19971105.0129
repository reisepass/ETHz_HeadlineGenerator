SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 5 (Xinhua) -- The design
for the Three Gorges Project (TGP) has stood the test of the
reality, a project official announced today.
With the damming of the Three Gorges Project approaching, the
application of a series of key technologies involved in the
project best indicated that the project's designing has been
reliable, said Wang Jiazhu, a hydro-engineering expert and deputy
manager of the China Yangtze Three Gorges Project Development
Corporation.
"Three Gorges Project calls for the application of unparalleled
complex technologies to the damming of Yangtze, construction of
two cofferdams, vertical excavation for construction of permanent
ship locks and an annual pouring intensity of 4 million cub m of
concrete work, as well as the concrete pouring for a 90-meter-high
dam during the dry season," explained Wang, who is in charge of
the technologies of the Three Gorges Project.
However, Wang said, the numerous technological problems have
been solved, "We are now fully confident with the successful
damming of the Yangtze, more than 60 percent of the excavation
work for building the permanent shiplocks has been completed, and
all technical difficulties concerning the building of cofferdams
and the concrete-pouring are also tackled," he added.
Experts of the management supervisor Yangtze River Water
Conservation Committee have kept a close look on the progress of
the project from the very beginning, together with a strict
self-supervision by the China Yangtze Three Gorges Project
Development Corporation, the TGP's proprietor.
Famous hydroelectric and dam engineering experts were also
invited from Canada, Brazil, the United States and Norway to act
as project consultants to help deal with technological
difficulties.
Nevertheless, according to another project official, more
knotty technical problems will possibly crop up as the project
enters into the second stage construction following the damming of
Yangtze.
"And we will continue to invite the world's first-class water
conservation or hydro-electric experts from overseas to give field
guidance at the worksite," said the expert-turned official.
