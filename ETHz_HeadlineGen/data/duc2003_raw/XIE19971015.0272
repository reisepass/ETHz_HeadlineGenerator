PRAGUE, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic, Hungary and
Poland, the first three countries invited to join the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), are aiming to further
strengthen their cooperation in a wide range.
Vaclav Havel and Goncz Arpad, presidents of the Czech Republic
and Hungary, after their meetings here today, stressed to
reporters the importance of strengthening the political, economic
and military cooperation among the three countries.
At NATO's Madrid Summit in July, the Czech Republic, Hungary
and Poland were invited to begin accession talks with the
organization. The three former Warsaw Pact countries are expected
to become new NATO members in 1999.
Goncz Arpad said that in the process of entering NATO,
coordinating the interests and steps among the three countries may
help saving costs and removing possible risks.
Goncz Arpad, who began his three-day state visit starting
October 13, is the first Hungarian president touring the Czech
Republic since it split from the former Czechoslovakia in 1993.
The Hungarian president today also met with Czech Prime
Minister Vaclav Klaus and Milos Zeman, chairman of the Chamber of
Deputies.
