PRAGUE, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin arrived here today for a three-day visit to discuss
NATO's eastward expansion with Czech leaders.
Chernomyrdin, the first Russian prime minister to visit the
country since the former Czechoslovakia split in 1993, will meet
his Czech counterpart, Vaclav Klaus, and Czech parliament leaders.
The Czech Republic is one the countries most likely to be
admitted into NATO during the military alliance's summit in July.
Russia strongly opposes the planned NATO eastward enlargement,
fearing it would bring nuclear and other weapons to its border. It
has demanded a binding treaty with NATO on a new Russian-NATO
relationship.
Prior to his departure, Chernomyrdin said that Moscow was
enhancing ties with the Czechs in many areas, with economic
cooperation as the priority, media reports said.
However, a Czech official remarked several days ago that the
Czech Republic would use the visit to tell Russia about its
position and interests in becoming a full NATO member.
Moscow is also concerned about a Czech decision last week to
buy 53 billion cubic meters of Norwegian natural gas over the next
20 years, since its Gazprom has been Czech's sole gas supplier.
