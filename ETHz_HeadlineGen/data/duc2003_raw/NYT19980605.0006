   TAKAYAMA, Japan _ In what colleagues hailed as a historic
landmark, 120 physicists from 23 research institutions in Japan and
the United States announced on Friday that they had found the
existence of mass in a notoriously elusive subatomic particle
called the neutrino.
   The neutrino, a particle that carries no electric charge, is so
light that it was assumed for many years to have no mass at all.
After Friday's announcement, cosmologists will have to confront the
possibility that much of the mass of the universe is in the form of
neutrinos. The discovery will also compel scientists to revise a
highly successful theory of the composition of matter known as the
Standard Model.
   Word of the discovery had drawn some 300 physicists here to
discuss neutrino research. Among other things, they said, the
finding of neutrino mass might affect theories about the formation
and evolution of galaxies and the ultimate fate of the universe. If
neutrinos have sufficient mass, their presence throughout the
universe would increase the overall mass of the universe, possibly
slowing its present expansion.
   Others said the newly detected but as yet unmeasured mass of the
neutrino must be too small to cause cosmological effects. But
whatever the case, there was general agreement here that the
discovery will have far-reaching consequences for the investigation
of the nature of matter.
   Speaking for the collaboration of scientists who discovered the
existence of neutrino mass using a huge underground detector called
Super-Kamiokande, Dr. Takaaki Kajita of the Institute for Cosmic
Ray Research of Tokyo University said that all explanations for the
data collected by the detector except the existence of neutrino
mass had been essentially ruled out.
   Dr. Yoji Totsuka, leader of the coalition and director of the
Kamioka Neutrino Observatory where the underground detector is
situated, 30 miles north of here in the Japan Alps, acknowledged
that his group's announcement was ``very strong,'' but said, ``We
have investigated all other possible causes of the effects we have
measured and only neutrino mass remains.''
   Dr. John Bahcall, a leading neutrino expert and astrophysical
theorist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.,
said in an interview that there had been many claims in recent
years of the discovery of neutrino mass by other groups. ``But this
one is by far the most convincing,'' he said. ``Besides the strong
evidence they have found, this team has a magnificent track record
of discoveries.''
   But because the elusive particles cannot be seen, the evidence
that they have mass is indirect.
   Under the Standard Model of matter, neutrinos come in three
types or ``flavors.'' The data gathered by the Super-Kamiokande
team during the two years the detector has operated indicate that
at least one of these three ``flavors'' can ``oscillate'' into one
of the other flavors as it travels along at nearly the speed of
light. According to the theories of quantum mechanics, any particle
capable of transforming itself in this way must have mass.
   Study of the neutrino particle has been glacially slow since its
existence was hypothesized in 1931 by the Austrian physicist
Wolfgang Pauli as a way to explain the mysterious loss of energy in
certain nuclear reactions. The particle was finally discovered in
1956 by two physicists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, Dr.
Frederick Reines (who was awarded a Nobel Prize for the discovery)
and the late Dr. Clyde Cowan.
   But understanding of the particle since then has been acquired
painfully slowly, because neutrinos have no electric charge and
rarely interact with any kind of matter. A neutrino so rarely
collides with an atom of ordinary matter that a typical neutrino
can easily penetrate a one-light-year thickness of lead _ some six
trillion miles _ without hindrance.

   As the writer John Updike put it in a poem he wrote in 1960:
   ``Neutrinos, they are very small.
   They have no charge and have no mass
   And do not interact at all.
   The earth is just a silly ball
   To them, through which they simply pass
   Like dust maids down a drafty hall.''
   But once in a great while, a neutrino does hit an atom and the
resulting blast of nuclear debris supplies clues about the neutrino
itself. The debris generally includes many particles that can race
through water, mineral oil or even ice, sending out shock waves of
blue light. This light, called Cherenkov radiation, can be detected
by sensitive light sensors and measured.
   During the past few decades, scientists have learned that matter
is made up of three distinct flavors or types. This means that
there are three flavors of neutrinos _ the electron neutrino
associated with the electron, the muon neutrinos, associated with
the muon particle, which is a kind of fat electron, and the tau
neutrino, associated with the tau particle, an even fatter relative
of the electron.
   The role of the muon and tau particles and their associated
neutrinos in the universe has mystified physicists. ``Who ordered
that?'' the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Isidor Rabi is said to
have remarked when the muon was found.

   The Super-Kamiokande detector was built two years ago as a joint
Japanese-American experiment. It is essentially a water tank the
size of a large cathedral installed in a deep zinc mine one mile
inside a mountain 30 miles north of here. When neutrinos slice
through the tank, one of them occasionally makes its presence known
by colliding with an atom, which sends blue light through the water
to an array of detectors.
   The enormous volume of water in the detector increased the
likelihood of neutrino impacts to the point at which the discovery
of neutrino mass became possible.
   The Super-Kamiokande collaboration is studying several neutrino
phenomenon simultaneously, but the one that led to Friday's
announcement was based on ``atmospheric'' neutrinos created when
highly energetic cosmic ray particles from deep space slam into the
Earth's upper atmosphere.
   Physicists knew that different flavors of neutrinos constantly
arrive from the upper atmosphere and they have calculated that the
ratio between muon neutrinos and other flavors must have a certain
value. But over the years detectors found only about half the muon
neutrino predicted by theory.
   The apparent shortage of muon neutrinos was explained by the
recent observations that led to Friday's announcement. The
physicists found that when neutrinos come from the sky directly
over the Super Kamiokande detector _ a relatively short distance _
the proportion of muon neutrinos among them was higher than among
the neutrinos coming up from beneath the detector after having
passed through the Earth.
   The scientists reasoned that by traveling through the entire
Earth these neutrinos had had time to oscillate, probably many
times, between muon neutrinos and some other type, especially the
tau neutrino, and this accounts for the deficit seen in muon
neutrinos. (The tau neutrino has not yet been directly detected but
it must exist to make observations consistent.)
   A related problem has to do with neutrinos produced by the
fusion process in the sun. This process, which merges the nuclei of
hydrogen atoms to form helium nuclei and energy, produces
neutrinos. Astrophysicists believe they understand the mechanism in
complete detail.
   The trouble is that all the best detectors ever built find far
fewer neutrinos than should be present according to understanding
of the fusion reaction.
   Scientists believe the anomaly can be explained by the
oscillation of detectable solar neutrinos into types that cannot be
detected by existing instruments. But no one has proven this
explanation.
   Investigation of the neutrino have not been limited to the
Super-Kamiokande collaboration.
   The leader of the collaboration's University of Hawaii Group,
for example, Dr. John Learned, has also worked on an underwater
detection system in the Pacific Ocean off the Hawaiian coast (which
ran out of money before completion) and a project at the South Pole
where a neutrino detector had been buried under thousands of feet
of ice.
   Another approach to penetrating the neutrino secrets involves
the use of particle accelerators capable of producing intense beams
of neutrinos. In two experiments currently being prepared, one in
Japan and the other at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in
Illinois, beams of neutrinos will be directed through the Earth
toward detectors several hundred miles away. The goal will be to
observe changes the neutrinos undergo in transit, both in numbers
and types. Physicists expect the experiment to confirm the
existence of neutrino oscillations like those seen in the
Super-Kamiokande detector.
   Although the neutrinos are now known to have some mass, most
physicists agree that the mass must be very small. The
Super-Kamiokande experiments suggest that the difference between
the masses of muon neutrinos and other types of neutrinos is only
about 0.07 electron volts (a measure of particle mass). This does
not yield a value of the masses themselves, only of the difference
between those of muon neutrinos and other types.
   Although the mass of the neutrino of any flavor must be small,
Totsuka said, it may be several electron-volts, and if so, the
overall gravitational effect on the universe would perhaps be
significant. It has been estimated that at any given moment, every
teaspoon worth of volume of space throughout the universe contains
an average of 300 neutrinos, so their aggregate number is
staggering.
   During the last 68 years, a legion of distinguished physicists
has devoted inquiries and careers to the puzzling neutrino, which
was given its name by the great Italian-American scientist Enrico
Fermi. Fermi quickly came to believe in the particle's existence,
even though it was not proved in his lifetime, and named it
``neutrino,'' which means ``little neutral one'' in Italian.
   Representatives of dozens of neutrino experiments meet once
every two years to exchange ideas at conferences like the one under
way here. Present are representatives of teams that have installed
neutrino detectors on the bottom of Lake Baikal in Siberia, under
the Aegean Sea off the Greek coast, inside the Gran Sasso tunnel
under the Alps, under the ice covering the South Pole, and in many
other places.
