LONDON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A 70-year-old man has become
the 11th victim in the food poisoning outbreak in Lanarkshire,
Scotland, and an expert has warned that the crisis could result in
up to 100 deaths.
BBC television said today that the Lanarkshire old man had been
in hospital suffering the food poisoning caused by the E coli
bacteria since November 30.
It was reported that E coli is a common gut bacteria that is
normally harmless, but a toxic strain that lives in cattle can be
passed to human via manure or improper slaughtering.
Two butcher's shops which were linked to the crisis have been
closed.
Professor Richard Lacey, a long-standing critic of the food
industry, said kidney failure could occur months after infection
with the E coli bacteria.
Lacey added that the factory which supplied the butcher at the
center of the crisis should be closed, and other outlets served by
the factory should also be shut down.
He also warned of the possible creation of a "super bug" in
which the E coli toxin combined with another bacterium.
