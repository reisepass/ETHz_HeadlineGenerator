	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Iowa Republicans on Monday scheduled  
their precinct caucuses next Feb. 7 -- two weeks earlier than 
planned -- and Democrats said they'll move to the same date. 
	The shift is aimed at fighting off a threat to the heavy  
attention the state gets in the presidential campaign. 
	``I am confident that presidential candidates and political  
observers will focus their attention and resources on the Iowa 
caucuses,'' Iowa Republican Chairman Kayne Robinson said at a news 
conference. 
	Iowa Democratic Party spokesman John Del Cecato said Democrats  
have been coordinating plans with Republicans, with national 
Democratic Party officials and with officials in New Hampshire, 
which holds the leadoff primary election. 
	``Whatever happens, we want to keep Iowa first,'' Del Cecato  
said. 
	The announcement is the latest twist in a quadrennial battle  
over the campaign calendar. 
	By tradition, Iowa's precinct caucuses are the first delegate  
selection event, followed eight days later by the New Hampshire 
primary. 
	In the last election cycle, Louisiana Republican officials held  
a delegate selection event prior to Iowa, but got little attention 
from candidates and there were questions about vote-counting. 
	The Louisiana GOP has decided to leapfrog again this year, and  
Robinson said Iowa Republicans would adjust. 
	The issue is important in both Iowa and New Hampshire, because  
presidential candidates devote huge time and attention campaigning 
in those relatively small states, and both parties benefit. 
	The caucuses ``are a real genuine test of a presidential  
candidate's ability to connect with the people of America,'' said 
Robinson. ``If you can survive in the crucible of hundreds of small 
towns and cafes and homes and connect and meet people face to face, 
that's a very important accomplishment for a candidate.''
