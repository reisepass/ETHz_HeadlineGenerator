   CITIES
   Bans exist in:
   Brooklyn, Ohio. The first ban in the nation was created a year
ago and since last Sept. 1, nearly 300 citations have been issued.
The law allows drivers to use hands-free speaker phones while
driving or to use their cell phones in the case of emergency. With
a fine of only $3 per violation, the law is intended more ro raise
public awareness of the issue than to punish.
   Hilltown Township, Consohocken, and Lebanon, Pa. These three
cities enacted bans on using cell phones while driving bans this
year after a much-publicized accident last fall in which a
2-year-old, Morgan Lee Pena, was killed by a driver talking on a
cell phone. The ban in Hilltown Township is being challenged in
court.
   New York City prohibits taxicab drivers from using cell phones
while driving.
   STATES
   This year, legislatures in 24 states considered bills to ban or
restrict cellphone use while driving. But so far, no state has
passed a law prohibiting cellphone use while driving. Bills in
Georgia, Texas and Ohio failed to proceed beyond consideration in
committee.
   In recent years, three states have enacted minor measures:
   Massachusetts requires drivers using cell phones to have one
hand on the wheel at all times.
   Florida bans the use of headsets. Drivers talking on cell phones
must have one ear uncovered at all times.
   California requires that written safety materials on cell-phone
use be included with all rental cars.
   Only two states, Minnesota and Oklahoma, offer law enforcement
officials a check-box on accident reports to indicate that the use
of a cell phone was a contributing factor in a accident.
Pennsylvania will soon start the practice. Other states and local
jurisdictions allow officers to write it in the report at their
discretion.
   FOREIGN COUNTRIES
   As a safety measure, 13 foreign countries have banned or
restricted the use of cell phones by motorists, though many allow
drivers to use hands-free sets.
   The countries are Germany, Japan, Australia, Brazil, United
Kingdom, Chile, Israel, Italy, Portugal, Spain, the Philippines,
Switzerland and Singapore.
