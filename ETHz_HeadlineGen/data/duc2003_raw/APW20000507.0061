   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Scientists trying to fathom the mystery of
schizophrenia say they have found the strongest evidence to date
that the disabling psychiatric disorder is caused by gene
abnormalities, according to a researcher at two state universities.
   A team led by Dr. Linda Brzustowicz, an assistant professor of
neuroscience at Rutgers University's Center for Molecular and
Behavioral Neuroscience in Newark, studied the DNA of dozens of
members of 22 families in which multiple generations suffered from
schizophrenia.
   The researchers recently published evidence that they found
abnormalities contributing to development of schizophrenia in a
region of Chromosome 1, one of the 23 chromosomes pairs that
contain a person's entire genetic code. Based on a statistical
analysis, their evidence linking that region to development of
schizophrenia was about 100 times stronger than any prior research,
Brzustowicz said last week.
   The team also found statistically weaker data implicating a
region of Chromosome 13 in the same families.
   ''Right now we are focusing on trying to identify the specific
gene on Chromosome 1 that's involved in this,'' said Brzustowicz,
who also is an assistant professor of psychiatry at University of
Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in Newark.
   The search is similar to trying to find a specific address upon
locating the right neighborhood.
   ''When we find it, we'll be able to say ... how does a defect in
that gene end up causing schizophrenia,'' Brzustowicz said. ''That
might give us insights into better ways of making drugs that treat
schizophrenia.''
   But Brzustowicz and other experts emphasized that it will be at
least a decade before new, safer schizophrenia drugs result. That's
partly because developing new drugs typically takes a decade, but
also because scientists have much to learn about the genetic and
environmental factors believed to contribute to schizophrenia.
   The disorder afflicts 2 million to 3 million Americans. It's
characterized by disturbed behavior, illogical thinking and speech,
depression and withdrawal from social interaction, and eventually,
delusional fixations and hallucinations. It usually surfaces
between the ages of 15 and 25.
   About 50 percent to 70 percent of schizophrenics hear
''voices,'' and antipsychotic drugs don't silence the voices for
about 20 percent. Those drugs also cause side effects from
sluggishness, blurry vision and facial twitches to liver and kidney
damage.
   Unlike many genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis and
Tay-Sachs disease where anyone inheriting a flawed gene develops
the disease, scientists believe schizophrenia is caused by the
interaction of possibly dozens of abnormal genes, said Dr. Kenneth
Kendler, professor of psychiatry and human genetics at Virginia
Commonwealth University and a member of the scientific advisory
board of the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and
Depression.
   In addition, researchers suspect schizophrenia might not occur
without one of the ''environmental'' triggers under study. Those
include exposure to viral infections, malnutrition or other stress
during pregnancy, and birth trauma such as the baby getting too
little oxygen during delivery.
   Dwight C. German, a professor of psychiatry at University of
Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, said the study by
Brzustowicz and colleagues, published in the April 28 issue of
Science magazine, ''really may well be a landmark paper.''
   ''It may well be the way they've designed their experiment ...
allowed them to get a stronger finding'' than prior studies, German
said.
   Researchers at the University of Toronto and the University of
British Columbia tracked down 288 members of 22 Canadian families,
all of whom were of Celtic or German descent, taking blood samples
from those with and without the disorder. Nearly half the families
had schizophrenics in three or more generations; past studies
generally have focused on identical twins or at least a single
generation.
   Brzustowicz and other collaborators in New Jersey analyzed each
person's DNA, segment by segment on each chromosome.
   ''We tried to match the pattern of inheritance of the pieces of
chromosome with the pattern of inheritance of the disease,'' she
said.
   Using computer analysis, they determined that there was only a
1-in-5,000 chance that the region where they found genetic
variations does not contribute to schizophrenia.
   Prior schizophrenia research has produced statistically weaker
evidence implicating regions of other chromosomes. But because the
studies often use different designs or ethnic groups, new studies
often contradict the results of earlier ones, Kendler said.
   ''Everybody wants to know which one is right,'' he said, adding
that the Brzustowicz study ''is about the largest statistical
evidence'' to date.
