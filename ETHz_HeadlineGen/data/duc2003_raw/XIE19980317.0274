BRUSSELS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) welcomed
the entry of the Greek currency drachma in the exchange rate mechanism
(ERM) of the European monetary system and the fixing of a new
central rate for the Irish pound.
President of the European Commission, Jacques Santer, and
Yves-Thibault de Silguy, the European commissioner responsible for
economic, monetary and financial affairs, made the announcement in
Brussels on Monday.
"The chosen central rate for the drachma is in line with the
fundamental characteristics of the Greek economy," they said in a
declaration.
Share prices rose sharply in Athens early Monday following a
weekend decision to admit the drachma to the European Monetary
System and to devalue it by 14 percent.
EU finance officials decided this weekend to admit Greece into
the European Monetary system at a new rate of 357 drachmas to the
European Currency Unit compared with a previous trading rate of
313.9.
The move was apparently aimed at boosting Greece's hopes of
joining the euro single currency, which it wants to do by 2001.
EMU is due to launch next January with Britain, Sweden and
Denmark opting out of early entry.
The Commission also said in the declaration that the new
central rate for the Irish pound was completely in line with the
performance of the Irish economy and the market situation.
The Irish punt has been the strongest currency in the ERM for
several months, going as high as 2.70 marks, far above its central
ERM rate of 2.41 marks.
