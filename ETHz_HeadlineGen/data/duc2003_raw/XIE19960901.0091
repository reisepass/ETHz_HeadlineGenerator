"From 1974-75 national production has been on its downward
trend every year," said Mtwara Regional Administrative Secretary
Mama Mary Luwilo recently.
Reasons for the sharp decline have been attributed to
diseases, insects, low prices, the ageing of trees, lack of care
for the crop after people had been moved to Ujamaa villages, bad
weather and lack of experts.
"To save the situation, the region introduced the cashew
improvement program. It was a special six-year program that
started in 1990/91 to June 30, 1996," she said.
It was jointly sponsored by the World Bank, the British and
Tanzanian governments when 25 million U.S. Dollars was set aside.
It is estimated that Mtwara has 86,000 hectares of land on
which some 10,679,500 cashew trees are grown.
The objective of the pogram was to increase production to
raise the income of the farmers.
"Other areas of improvement included deep research into the
crop, producing and distributing better seeds, to advise the
government on the markets and to supervise the availability of
fertilisers," the regional administrative secretary said.
"As far as the region is concerned the program is a success,"
she said with confidence.
Mary Luwilo explained that following its implementation,
production had increaed from 15,209 tons in 1990/91 to 49,106
tons in 1995/96.
She said cashew farmers were now able to sell their crop on
competitive prices and that there had been a lot of improvement
in the production and distribution of better seeds.
The regional adminstraive secretary also said that a fund for
the purchase of farm implements and other in-puts was established
in the 1994/95 season. She said the 110 million Tanzania
Shillings (about 183,000 U.S. Dollars) fund was aimed at
providing the farmers with tools and in-puts at reasonable
prices.
During the last season the fund bought and distributed to
farmers 21 tons of millet and maize, 33 tons of fertilizer, and
various insecticides.
She said that cashew farmers were being motivated to maintain
their farms properly and the district councils had drafted
by-laws to ensure the crop was developed according to acceptable
standards.
In further efforts to spread and develop the crop, seedlings
were given to farmers, she added. enditem
