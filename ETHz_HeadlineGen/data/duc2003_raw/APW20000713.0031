   LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) -- The audience was encouraged to applaud,
murmur, hiss or shout hallelujah. One sign on stage simply called
for ''hubbub'' -- not surprising, given the subject being debated.
   Seventy-five years after the Scopes ''monkey trial'' over the
teaching of evolution, parts of the landmark court case were
re-enacted in Kansas, the latest ground zero in the battle over
what to teach kids about the origin of life.
   As about 1,500 people watched, actors read from transcripts of
the 1925 trial in Tennessee that pitted William Jennings Bryan
against defense attorney Clarence Darrow.
   The outcome was never in doubt. Biology teacher John Scopes was
convicted and fined $100 for teaching evolution. His conviction was
later overturned by the Tennessee Supreme Court on procedural
grounds.
   One exchange elicited both laughter and applause. Bryan, played
by Ed Asner (''Lou Grant,'' ''Mary Tyler Moore Show''), turned to
his colleague and said: ''You may guess -- evolutionists guess.''
   Darrow, played by James Cromwell (''Babe,'' ''L.A.
Confidential''), replied, ''But when we do guess, we have the sense
to guess right.''
   The People for the American Way Foundation sponsored the event
as well as a panel discussion and debate on evolution and
creationism following the performance.
   Foundation president Ralph Neas said the state education board's
decision in August 1999 to de-emphasize evolution in science
testing standards made Kansas a natural venue for the event.
   ''How Kansas resolves this dispute will ripple out in all
directions to affect the education of millions of children who have
never even set foot in this state,'' Neas said.
   Evolution, first propounded by Charles Darwin, states that the
Earth is billions of years old and that life forms developed over
millions of years.
   Creationism, or creation science, teaches that the Earth and
most life forms came into existence suddenly about 6,000 years ago.
Critics have attacked it as a disguise for a literal translation of
the Bible's Book of Genesis.
   A Gallup Poll conducted last year found that 68 percent of
American adults favored teaching both creationism and evolution in
the public schools. By a margin of 55 percent to 40 percent, they
opposed replacing evolution with creationism. The margin of error
was plus or minus 3 percentage points.
   The debate has heated up recently in a number of states,
including Alabama, Idaho, Nebraska, New Mexico, West Virginia,
Arizona, Michigan, Indiana, Louisiana, Kentucky, Oklahoma,
Illinois, Washington and Colorado.
   Neas said activities in those states have ranged from efforts to
delete evolution from science standards and tests to including a
disclaimer in textbooks downplaying the importance of the theory.
   In Kansas, the science standards that de-emphasize evolution
also make no mention of the big-bang theory of the origin of the
universe. The standards are used to develop statewide tests for
students.
   The board's decision to approve them focused national attention
on Kansas and made evolution a political issue. Five of the board's
10 seats will be filled in the Nov. 7 general election.
   Linda Holloway, who was the board's chairwoman when it approved
the new science standards and is seeking re-election, said that
while the evolution debate continues 75 years after the Scopes
trial, creationists are the ones under attack now.
   ''We've come 180 degrees; now we've got censorship the other
way,'' Holloway said Tuesday at the board's monthly meeting. She
did not attend Wednesday's event, which drew people on both sides
of the debate.
   Jack Krebs, representing Kansas Citizens for Science,
distributed fliers criticizing the Kansas board's decision, while
Eric and Celtie Johnson displayed anti-evolution signs. One said,
''Reject evolution, thousands of scientists do!''
   Before the re-creation, Kansas native Asner said scientists have
accumulated evidence in ''a million different ways'' to support
evolution since the Scopes trial.
   ''Kansas has put itself in a more bumbling situation with this
board than Tennessee was 75 years ago,'' he said.
