YICHANG, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The China Yangtze River Three
Gorges Development Project Corp. invited 22 noted Chinese water
conservancy and hydropower experts to act as consultants for the
project to dam the Yangtze River in early November.
The construction schedule calls for the Three Gorges Dam to be
isolated from the main stream of the Yangtze River, China's
longest river, between November 6-8.
The group of experts recently visited the construction site in
central China's Hubei Province to inspect preparatory work and
offer suggestions for a revised construction plan. The experts
took part in in-depth discussions concerning the possibility of
technical problems related to the damming of the Yangtze and the
second-phase construction of cofferdams.
The experts pointed to the fact the developer is
technically prepared to ensure the successful damming of the river.
The Three Gorges Dam is considered to be one of the world's
most complex projects in terms of difficulty in damming and for
technology needed to complete the dam.
Years of extensive research have enabled China to resolve all
major technical problems involved damming the Yangtze. The
development corporation has completed repeated successful
experiments simulating the damming effort.
