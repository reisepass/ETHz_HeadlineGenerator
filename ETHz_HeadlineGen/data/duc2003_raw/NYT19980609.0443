   It will be the only college football contest played this season
in which the lowest score wins.
   Officials of the new Bowl Championship Series have approved a
statistical rating system to decide the nation's top two teams, as
well as other schools eligible to participate in the four-bowl
series.
   The rating system has four components: the average ranking in
the Associated Press and coaches' poll, the average of three
computer rankings, the strength of schedules and team records.
   The system, officials hope, will be particularly helpful in
those years when it's not obvious which two teams are the best.
   ``It's clear-cut and it's very objective,'' said Roy Kramer,
chairman of the Southeastern Conference and the series coordinator,
said of the rating system.
   The Bowl Championship Series, the successor to the alliance, is
designed to guarantee that the nation's two teams are matched in a
bowl every year. The Fiesta Bowl will host the title game this
season.
   The national title will still be determined by the postseason
polls, and no one thinks the rating system will diminish the
support of those who want a playoff.
   ``Not as long as there are newspaper columnists and call-in
shows,'' Kramer said.
   The rating system not only will select which teams play in the
title game but will determine whether an independent or a team from
a conference without an automatic bid in the series is guaranteed a
slot in one of the four participating bowls: the Fiesta, the
Orange, the Sugar and the Rose. Those teams must finish in the top
six in the final series poll.
   The point system will not be used to determine the match-ups in
the series' other non-championship bowl games. Those bowls, each
with a conference tie-in, can determine their best match-ups among
eligible teams.
   The Fiesta Bowl, for instance, would still be free to choose to
do what it did last year when it picked Kansas State as an at-large
team largely because the Wildcats bring thousands of fans with
them.
   The four bowls will host the series' top game on a rotating
basis. This will be the first season in which the top two ranked
teams are assured of meeting in a bowl.
   That was impossible in previous years because the Rose Bowl did
not participate in the agreement, which eliminated Pac-10 and Big
Ten teams from the arrangement.
   ``We are confident and comfortable with the system,'' said John
Junker, the Fiesta Bowl's, executive director. ``Since our game is
the focus of college football this year, it's awfully nice to have
it resolved.''
   If the current agreement had been in place two years ago,
Arizona State would have played Florida State for the title. Last
season, Nebraska and Michigan would have played.
   Series officials won't begin releasing its rating until November
because early season ratings are meaningless, Kramer said. The
strength-of-schedule category is only pertinent when teams have
played at least seven or eight games, he said.
   The series probably will not eliminate all controversy. There
could be a scenario in which the same two teams are ranked Nos. 1
and 2 in the AP and coaches' polls, yet the rating system
determines the third-ranked team should play for the national
title.
   That would have happened in 1990, when Colorado was ranked
first, Georgia Tech second and Texas was third. Colorado and Texas
would have played for the national title because their schedules
were deemed tougher than Georgia Tech's, which ended up sharing the
national title with Colorado.
   Another possibility is that neither team in the championship
plays well and the third-rated team is impressive in its bowl
appearance.
   Since the final polls still determine the national champion,
it's possible voters could choose to elevate the third-ranked team
to No. 1. &QL;
