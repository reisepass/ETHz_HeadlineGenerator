HANOI, April 19 (Xinhua)-- Vietnam has become the third largest
cashew producer in the world, next only to India and Brazil, with
100,000 tonnes exported last year.
In 1995, Vietnam's cashews reaped a total turnover of 100
million U.S. dollars and provided jobs for 15,000 workers.
Vietnamese cahsews currently occupy five to 10 percent of the
American market which consumes two-thirds of all cashews grown in
the world.
The American company Donafood in southern Vietnam plans to
triple its exports to the U.S. market next year, totalling 50
percent of its planned production.
However, the English language daily "Vietnam News " said,
problems remain to temper such optimism.
One imperative problem is how to fulfil the export
contracts. The processing companies cannot operate at full
capacity because of a lack of capital and raw material.
Weather vagaries can hurt production. Production this year has
decreased remarkably because of the cold and destructive insects.
Farmers also suffer losses through intermediaries as they can't
sell their product directly to prcessing companies.
Growers claim a proper policy with incentives is needed to tap
Vietnam's current strong potential on the international
market.
