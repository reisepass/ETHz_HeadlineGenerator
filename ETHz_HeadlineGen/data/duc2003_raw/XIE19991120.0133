NAIROBI, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi has urged Kenyans to scrap tribalism in order to tackle
challenges in the next millennium.
Moi was quoted by Saturday's East African Standard newspaper as
saying that the root cause of instability in many countries was
tribalism and it should be eradicated if meaningful development
was to be achieved.
He criticized some political leaders Friday at a rally for
dividing Kenyans along tribal lines instead of cultivating peace,
adding that such leaders should be rejected by people.
The president warned that anyone who found inciting people into
tribal clashes would face the punishment of law.
Moi also said that Kenya is a peaceful country and will not
tolerate alien dictates that could plunge Kenya into chaos.
