MANILA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Year 2000 (Y2K) Asian regional
coordinators Wednesday signed a historic Y2K declaration that will
lay down the framework for the region's approach to the millennium
bug debacle as the Second Global Y2K Summit was closed here.
The Declaration of Cooperation and Support of Asian Y2K
Coordinators summarized the priorities of action which will be
implemented by the regional coordinators in the Asia Pacific
region.
The regional coordinators agreed to work together and intensify
efforts in sharing information across borders on Y2K issues and
minimizing adverse Y2K effects on vital sectors.
They called on the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and
other financial and multilateral organizations to review and
increase their level of support for national and regional Y2K
efforts.
The declaration, the world's first to be executed by regional
Y2K coordinators, will further strengthen Asia's link with other
international coordinators through the Washington-based
International Y2K Cooperation Center.
Amable Aguiluz, chairman of the Philippine Commission on Y2K
Compliance, said at the closing ceremony of the summit that Asian
coordinators agreed that the Y2K bug is "not a mere technical
problem but is a social management problem."
If it is not addressed, it will adversely affect the delivery
of essential services in critical sectors including power,
telecommunications, finance, transport and health, he added.
On the three-day summit, Aguiluz said it has already achieved
its objectives of raising awareness on the Y2K problem and
exchanging information and views among experts.
