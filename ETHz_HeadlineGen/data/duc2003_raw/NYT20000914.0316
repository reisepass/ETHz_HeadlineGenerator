   WASHINGTON _ A poll released Thursday shows that a flurry of
recent reports of innocent inmates being freed from death row has
left a deep impression with the public and cut into support for
capital punishment in the United States.
   The poll, a joint effort by Republican and Democratic polling
firms, showed that overall support for the death penalty has
slipped to 60 percent, and 64 percent of Americans would support a
moratorium on capital punishment.
   Before the cases began to capture headlines, about 80 percent of
Americans endorsed capital punishment.
   According to the survey, conducted by Peter D. Hart Research
Associates, a Democratic firm, and American Viewpoint, a Republican
company, voters are increasingly worried that the judicial system
might make a mistake.
   Asked what worries them most about the death penalty, 69 percent
said they feared that an innocent person might be executed, and 24
percent worried about a guilty person avoiding execution.
   Nine out of 10 voters thought death row inmates should be given
the opportunity to have DNA testing done. More than 80 percent of
those polled wanted defendants in capital cases to have
experienced, capable lawyers.
   The poll of 802 registered voters was conducted in late August
and was commissioned by the Justice Project, a nonprofit group that
specializes in death row issues.
