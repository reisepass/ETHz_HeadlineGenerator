	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ Mahmoud El-Farnawani, paid dlrs 58,000 as
a consultant for the Salt Lake bid committee in 1994-95, says he
delivered access _ not votes _ to Utah Olympic boosters.
	   The former Egyptian national volleyball coach, who now lives in
Toronto, told The Salt Lake Tribune and the Deseret News that he
did not attempt to buy votes of International Olympic Committee
members in behalf of Salt Lake's successful bid for the 2002 Winter
Games.
	   El-Farnawani said that through his coaching experience, he
became acquainted with nearly three dozen IOC members.
	   ``I made introductions, gave Salt Lake City all the knowledge
about this person or that family, what he likes, however many
children he has, what his history is and so on, so they know
something about him, like what he eats,'' he told The Tribune.
	   ``Some people from my group don't eat pork or ham, or don't want
to have alcohol on the table. It all helps to make the IOC member
feel he is taken care of and to feel they (bidders) respect his
background and religion,'' he said.
	   El-Farnawani was quoted by the Toronto Sun in 1995 as saying
that he ``assured'' the IOC's Arab vote for Salt Lake.
	   ``I offered my service to Quebec,'' another of the four cities
that sought the 2002 Games, El-Farnawani was quoted then as saying.
``But they didn't want anybody from outside Quebec. So I signed a
contract with Salt Lake City and assured them of all the Arab
votes.''
	   The Deseret News, in a copyright story Tuesday, said
El-Farnawani declined to say which IOC members he contacted. ``If
you trust me to work with people, I won't expose who I contacted,''
he said.
	   The implication that he made bribes, made in a Toronto
newspaper, ``is very, very stupid,'' El-Farnawani told The Tribune.
``Salt Lake did not need that. They knew they were going to win.
... Linking me to (bribery allegations) has to come from someone
who is jealous or envied my success.''
	   George Gross, the Toronto Sun reporter who interviewed
El-Farnawani in Budapest in 1995, shortly after the IOC voted to
award the 2002 Winter Games to Salt Lake City, said he stands by
his story.
	   El-Farnawani said that he had been unaware of the Salt Lake
boosters' scholarships for IOC relatives.
	   In another development Tuesday, the Salt Lake Organizing
Committee hired the international law firm Latham -and- Watkins,
which has 850 attorneys in 14 cities, to represent it in whatever
issues may arise with the U.S. Justice Department.
	   Attorney General Janet Reno said last week she is reviewing the
case to see if it merits a full investigation. ``Nothing has
changed,'' a spokesman said Tuesday.
