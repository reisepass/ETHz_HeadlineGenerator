MADRID, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) has decided to invite the Czech Republic,
Hungary and Poland to join the alliance, NATO Secretary General
Javier Solona announced here today at the end of the first day
meeting of a two-day summit in Madrid, Spain.
The invitation marks the official implementation of NATO's
eastward expansion plan, which came into being three and a half
years ago.
According to NATO's initial arrangements, the Czech Republic,
Hungary and Poland will respectively begin three-month
negotiations on their accession to NATO from September. If the
talks could go smoothly, a protocol would be signed in
December. Then, from early next year, NATO's current 16 members
will begin their ratification process.
If nothing goes wrong, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland
will become NATO's new members in April 1999 when NATO, the only
military alliance existing after the end of the Cold War, marks
the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Washington.
NATO's current members are Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France,
Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Norway, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the
United States.
NATO leaders were at first split over if Romania and Slovenia
should be included in the invitation in the first wave of NATO's
expansion eastwards. Nine members led by France and Italy intended
to include Romania and Slovenia but six other members led by the
United States wanted the two to wait for the next wave.
