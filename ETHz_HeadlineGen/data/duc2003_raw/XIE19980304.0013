WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Vernon Jordan, a close friend
of U.S. President Bill Clinton, Tuesday appeared before a federal
grand jury investigating accusations that Clinton asked former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky to deny their alleged affair.
Arriving at the U.S. District Court Tuesday morning, Jordan
refused to answer reporters' questions.
White House Press secretary Mike McCurry said "luckily, someone
who knows the facts" will be testifying. He described Jordan as
a "truthful and honest man."
Asked if the truth will help the president, McCurry said,
"Absolutely."
McCurry denied the Lewinsky case had strained the friendship
between Clinton and Jordan, but he said they no longer discuss it
for legal reasons.
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr is investigating why Jordan
helped Lewinsky get a job while she was providing an affidavit in
Paula Jones's sexual harassment lawsuit against the president.
Earlier Jordan had said Clinton and Lewinsky assured him there
was no sexual relationship between them, and that Clinton's
private secretary, Betty Currie, asked him to help Lewinsky find a
job.
Lewinsky's attorney, William Ginsburg, reportedly said his
client sought Jordan's help in early November, before she knew she
would be a witness in the Jones case.
