   WASHINGTON _ California's free-for-all primary election system,
which allows voters to choose candidates without regard to party
affiliation, violates the rights of state political parties, the
Supreme Court ruled Monday.
   In a 7-2 decision, the court called the state's system a
``severe and unnecessary'' burden on the right of a political party
to define its own message and decide its own candidates.
   The system, known a blanket primary, allows any voter _ whether
registered as a Democrat, Republican, third-party member or
independent _ to vote for the nomination of any candidate from any
party for any race.
   Writing for the court, Justice Antonin Scalia said California
violated the First Amendment's right to free association by
``forcing political parties to associate with those who do not
share their beliefs.
   ``In no area is the political association's right to exclude
more important than in its candidate-selection process,'' Scalia
wrote.
   The ruling means that California _ along with Washington state
and Alaska, which have similar systems _ will be forced to change
the way they conduct primaries.
   Scalia said the states could hold a nonpartisan blanket primary,
in which voters can choose any candidate, regardless of
affiliation, and the top two vote-getters move on to the general
election. The system he described would be similar to that adopted
by Louisiana in 1975.
   Under such a plan, Scalia said, ``primary voters are not
choosing a party's nominee'' and therefore political parties'
rights of free association are not harmed.
   His opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter,
Clarence Thomas and Stephen G. Breyer.
   Dissenting were Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader
Ginsburg. Writing for the two, Stevens said the court should
``respect the policy choice made by the state's voters'' in
approving the proposition that created the blanket primaries.
   But George Waters, who represented the political parties before
the high court, praised the majority decision, saying parties have
the right to define their membership. ``The court agreed that
blanket primaries violate that right by inviting voters with no
loyalty to the party to influence the selection of the party's
nominees.''
   Disagreeing, California Secretary of State Bill Jones noted that
the vast majority of voters supported the blanket primary system.
``I don't know who the parties are afraid of. The vast majority of
their members supported this,'' he said.
   In 1996, California voters passed Proposition 198, setting up
the blanket-primary system, which allows voters, regardless of
their political registration, to cast ballots in such elections to
select any candidate for any office.
   For example, a voter could choose a candidate in the Democratic
presidential primary and, at the same time, vote for a candidate in
the Republican primary for U.S. Senate and then vote to nominate an
independent candidate for a House seat.
   California adopted the single-ballot, blanket form of primary to
give the state's 1.6 million independent voters their first chance
to vote in what had been a ``closed'' primary system limited to
party members.
   Washington state has used the blanket primary since 1935. Alaska
enacted a similar law in 1947.
   Blanket-primary supporters argued that the system would
encourage voter turnout and lead to the nomination of more moderate
candidates.
   But California's Democratic, Republican, Libertarian and Peace &AMP;
Freedom parties immediately challenged the system, contending it
violated their First Amendment right of ``freedom of association.''
   The national Democratic and Republican parties filed briefs
supporting that contention.
   In 1997, U.S. District Court Judge David Levi ruled that the
blanket primary was constitutional. Levi said that although the
system was an ``intrusion on a party's traditional right to select
its own candidates,'' the burden on the parties was not enough of a
``significant burden'' to justify striking down the law.
   Last year, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed. It
thought so highly of Levi's ruling that it simply adopted his
opinion ``as the opinion of our court.''
   On Monday, the Supreme Court reversed that decision.
   ``As for affording voters greater choice, it is obvious that the
net effect of this scheme ... is to reduce the scope of choice, by
assuring a range of candidates who are all more centrist,'' Scalia
said.
   The court's decision avoided deciding the validity of the more
common open primary system used in another 20 states. In an open
primary, voters are allowed to choose which party's primary they
will vote in. Such voters get to select the nominees of one party
only.
   This is the type of system that aided former Republican
presidential candidate John McCain in states such as Michigan,
where Democrats and independents were allowed to vote in the
Republican primary.
   Thirteen states have closed primaries, which allow only party
members to vote in each party's primary. Another 13 states have
closed primaries but also let independent voters cast ballots in at
least one party's primary.
