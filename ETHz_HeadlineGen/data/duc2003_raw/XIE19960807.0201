NEW DELHI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Foreign Secretary
Faroq Sobhan is expected to arrive here today for talks with India
on three long-standing issues troubling bilateral relations -
Ganges water-sharing, trade imbalance and transit, the Indian
Express said today.
Analysts here believe that while a long-term agreement to the
contentious water-sharing problem may not be easy to come by, it
is imperative, in view of improved Indo-Bangladeshi relations,
that a short-term solution should be worked out.
While water-sharing may be Dhaka's foremost concern, India is
equally keen on transit rights for Indian goods to its North
Eastern states.
But India's request has been met with fears that providing a
transit route through Bangladesh would pose a security risk to
that country.
Analysts said there is a possibility that India may be willing
to sort out the water-sharing problem with Bangladesh in exchange
for a transit route for Indian goods.
