WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Kenneth Prewitt, the
administration's census director nominee, on Thursday told the
U.S. Senate Governmental Affairs Committee that it was crucial
that the issue of statistical sampling be settled soon.
Senators had told Prewitt, head of the Social Science Research
Council in New York, that he will face strong political pressures
regardless of how the Supreme Court rules on a disputed counting
method for the 2000 census.
Prewitt said that if the Supreme Court does not rule before
March 1 of next year -- 13 months before Census 2000 -- he would
"have to convene some sort of emergency meeting" with Congress to
decide how to conduct the census.
A three-judge federal panel last month invalidated the Census
Bureau's plans to use sampling. The administration has challenged
that decision, and the Supreme Court is likely to hand down a
final ruling by next spring.
"You are going to get pressures from all sides," said Senator
Fred Thompson, a Republican and chairman of the committee. "Let me
urge you not to become too good a politician."
The ranking Democrat on the committee, Senator John Glenn,
stressed that Prewitt would have to move quickly to get more money
from Congress if the Supreme Court says sampling is
unconstitutional, "or this thing will be a big flop."
Prewitt agrees with the Census Bureau that the proper use of
sampling -- the statistical estimation of hard-to-find people _
would improve the accuracy of the count and cut the costs of the
decennial census. The 1990 census missed an estimated four million
people.
But sampling is strongly opposed by Republicans, who say the
Constitution requires every person to be counted. Census results
are used to reapportion seats in the House of Representatives and
to determine distribution of federal funds, and sampling could
raise population figures in previously undercounted urban and
minority areas that traditionally support the Democrats.
Prewitt said the 350,000 people and the four billion dollar
budget needed to conduct the 2000 census would have to be
significantly increased if sampling is disallowed.
"At present the bureau is proceeding with a two-track strategy,
with and without sampling, and the sooner this key issue is
resolved, the better," Prewitt said in a written reply to
questions from the committee.
The House's census subcommittee on Thursday heard testimony
from experts who said sampling would add to the complexity of the
census without reducing the level of errors.
But it also heard from the Bush Administration Census Bureau
director, Barbara Everitt Bryant, who said sampling was needed to
improve upon the accuracy of the 1990 census. She said the
prohibition imposed by the federal court, if not overturned by the
Supreme Court, "virtually guarantees undercount in the upcoming
census."
