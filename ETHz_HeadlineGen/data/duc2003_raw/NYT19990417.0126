   DENVER _ Airline pilots typically learn in simulators how to
handle engine failure, stormy winds and other disruptions in
flight. But now United and other airlines are tossing them more
radical problems _ like what to do when a jumbo jet rolls nearly
upside down.
   It is such a rare event that the lesson may seem pointlessly
exotic. A commercial jet is almost as stable as a city bus; the
most frequent flier will probably never experience more than a
30-degree roll to one side, or feel the nose point down more than 5
degrees or up more than 18.
   Even pilots may fly 30 years without encountering the kind of
emergency for which United is training them.
   ``Their experience seeing what the world looks like upside-down
is pretty limited,'' said one aviation safety expert, Stuart
Matthews, president of the Flight Safety Foundation. Fighter pilots
fly that way, but in recent years fewer airline pilots have
military experience.
   The training was begun by United Airlines, with American, Delta,
USAirways, Continental and Alaska following suit, after a 1996
recommendation from the National Transportation Safety Board.
Airlines say that no single incident convinced them, but that the
crash of USAir 427 in Pittsburgh in September 1994, encouraged them
to prepare pilots. That plane, a Boeing 737, went out of control
apparently because of a rudder malfunction, and led to debates
among pilots about whether the plane was ``recoverable'' in the
air.
   There is no debate, though, that inexperience with ``unusual
attitudes,'' situations in which the plane may roll or pitch, lulls
pilots into a false sense of security and leaves them with no
guidance when something goes extremely wrong, like a flight control
that sticks, or a strong atmospheric disturbance.
   In the case of an upside-down jet, for example, the solution is
to use not only the normal flight controls but also the rudder,
which is hardly ever used in the cruise phase of flight. The way to
convince a pilot of that is to show, not tell, but that is hardly
practical with a $200 million plane.
   Similarly, if a plane's nose is pointing too high, United
teaches them that the fast way to level the airplane is not to use
the usual controls on the tail, but to bank very steeply, a
maneuver that most pilots may have seen only in old World War II
movies.
   The course takes about a half-hour of the 12 hours that pilots
spend in simulators during their annual re-training.
   ``Pilots get very little practice, if any at all, on what we
call unusual attitudes, or upsets,'' Matthews said. That includes
situations where the plane rolls steeply sideways or even upside
down, or pitches up and seems to want to stand on its tail.
   So at United's flight training center here on the grounds of the
old Stapleton Airport, three dozen simulators can tilt, rock and
roll on hydraulic platforms to simulate extreme changes in flight,
as computer monitors mimic what the pilots would see out the
windows in a real flight emergency.
   During their three days of annual retraining, Capt. John C.
Penney drills crews on what to do if something throws the plane out
of kilter.
   Inside the simulator, instructors like Penney, the program
manager for advanced maneuvers, start them off. ``Attitude,'' he
barks, as the pilot is supposed to, to alert the other pilot of a
problem. Then the drill is to glance across the control panel at
the second pilot's instruments, to confirm that the problem is with
the plane and not with a malfunctioning instrument. The next step
is to disconnect the autopilot and aggressively work the controls
to level off the plane.
   That is when Penney shows off the rudder trick.
   The rudder is the movable panel on the vertical fin of the tail.
Operated with the feet, it is used mostly to keep the plane pointed
straight down the runway when taking off or landing in a crosswind.
Most of the steering in flight is accomplished by ailerons, the
panels on the backs of the wings, which are used to tilt one wing
up and the other down in a controlled roll that makes the plane
turn.
   When his simulator goes into an extreme roll, Penney first has
the crews try to right the plane with the ailerons alone.
Instruments show an accelerating plunge.
   Then he has the crews try using the rudder along with the
ailerons. That pushes the nose to one side, skidding the plane
slightly sideways. Now the wings are no longer swept back equally
from the direction of travel. One is almost perpendicular to the
direction of travel, and thus produces more lift; the other,
aligned nearly parallel to the direction of travel and shielded
from the wind by the fuselage, produces much less lift. The uneven
lift helps roll the plane right side up.
   ``It's not show-boating or hot-dogging,'' said Penney, a former
fighter pilot. ``It's an eye-opening exercise.''
