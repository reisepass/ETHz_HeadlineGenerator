	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- After three fatal crashes, the Air Force is  
permanently grounding its T-3A Firefly training planes and turning 
its introductory flight training over to commercial flight schools. 
	The Air Education and Training Command at Randolph Air Force  
base made the announcement on Saturday. 
	The new introductory training program, using Federal Aviation  
Administration-certified schools, is expected to save about $16 
million a year in operating costs. 
	It also increases the training time for incoming pilots from 40  
hours to 50 hours and requires they earn a private pilot's license. 
After completing the introductory program, pilots enter the Air 
Force's undergraduate pilot training programs. 
	The Firefly, a powerful British propeller plane capable of loops  
and other aerobatic maneuvers, has had reported problems with 
engine stalling. 
	The Air Force Academy suspended the plane's use in 1997 after  
three cadets and three instructors died in Firefly crashes over a 
three-year period. Two of the crashes were blamed on pilot error, 
and the other remains unexplained, though Pentagon officials have 
said the instructor should have been able to recover the plane 
after it stalled. 
	The easily maneuverable planes had been used to assess if cadets  
could handle the rigors of jet school.
