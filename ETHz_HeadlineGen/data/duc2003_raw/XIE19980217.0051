PARIS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- France will join the envisaged
United Nations peacekeeping force in the Central African Republic,
which will replace an African peacekeeping force deployed in
Bangui since January 1997.
French ambassador to the Central African Republic Jean-Marc
Simon met last weekend with the country's president, Ange-Felix
Patasse, promising him that France will send a "small contingent"
of soldiers to provide logistical support and back-up in the
medical and health field to the U.N. force.
The United Nations Security Council will vote on February 23 on
the dispatch of a 1,400-man U.N. force to Bangui at the request of
United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan.
The Inter-African Mission of Supervision of the Bangui
Agreements (MISAB) will end its mission on March 15, but soldiers
from seven countries joining the MISAB are expected to continue
serving in the U.N. force.
The Central African Republic, one of the poorest in Africa, was
shaken by several mutinies in 1996 and is troubled by tribal
tension.
France will close its military barracks in the country and
withdraw its 1,400 soldiers as part of its troop re-deployment in
Africa.
