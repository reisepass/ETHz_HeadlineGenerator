BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Some 150 pilots and flight
technicians from China's civil aviation industry and the air force
attended a seminar on flight techniques for the next century,
which opened here today.
The two-day event, co-organized by the Boeing Commercial
Airplane Group and the China Civil Aviation Association, deals
with new trends in flight deck design and air control management,
and new flight safety problems crews might encounter with the
development of flight techniques.
Captain J. Kenneth Higgins, vice-president of flight operations
and testing, and James E. Veitengruber, chief of flight deck
engineering of Boeing's civil aircraft arm, are the main lecturers
at the seminar.
Since 1988 Boeing has held training courses and seminars on
flight safety and airline management for the technical and
management staff of the Chinese aviation industry, said Yeh Huang,
vice-president of Boeing China.
He said hundreds of Chinese pilots and other flight crew
members have been sent to Boeing for training, and the company is
co-operating with China's civil aviation authorities on a major
project to improve China's air traffic management system.
"Boeing will hold more such activities in China in the future,"
Huang said.
Boeing planes account for nearly 70 percent of the total of
Western-made commercial airplanes now in use in China.
Its arch-rival, the European consortium Airbus Industrie, is
vigorously competing with Boeing for a bigger share of the Chinese
civil aviation market, the world's fastest-growing one with an
annual growth rate of 20 percent in its air traffic flow.
Airbus held a similar seminar in Sichuan Province in
March. During Chinese Premier Li Peng's visit to France last
month, a deal involving the purchase of 30 Airbuses worth about
1.5 billion US dollars was struck between China and the consortium.
China plans to add about 300 new planes to its commercial
fleet, according to the Civil Aviation Administration of China, of
which the vast majority will be Western-made ones manufactured by
Boeing, Airbus and McDonnell Douglas, among others.
