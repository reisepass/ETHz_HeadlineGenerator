CHONGQING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to relocate
125,000 people living in the dam area of the Three Gorges Power
Project to 11 regions in coastal provinces in the next nine years.
The relocation project is of great significance. Firstly, it
will help improve the environment in the dam area of the Three
Gorges Power Project, the largest hydro-electric power project in
China and the world.
The forest coverage rate of this densely-populated area has
dropped from 26 percent in the 1950s to 17 percent at present.
Sixtytwo percent of the 21,667 square kilometers of land in the
Three Gorges dam area suffer from soil erosion. An estimated 40
million tons of sand in the region silts up in the Yangtze River
annually.
The relocation of the 125,000 people to other parts of China
will make it possible for the region to cover the barren land at
mountain slopes with trees and grass.
Secondly, relocation of residents in the dam area to better-off
regions on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River
provides a larger space of living for the migrants.
The population density in the dam area is more than double the
national average. As many as 260 people are cramped into an area
of one square kilometer.
When the water level of the Three Gorges Reservoir rises to a
height of 175 meters, 26,000 ha of farmland is expected to be
inundated, and the life of 340,000 rural residents will be
affected.
If the affected farmers move to Shanghai, Guangdong, Jiangsu
and other economically-developed coastal areas, they will have
ample opportunities to use their skills and expertise to become
better off in a shorter period of time.
Thirdly, the relocation project also offers an opportunity for
the areas where the migrants will resettle to achieve rapid
economic developments.
Jiangsu Province, for instance, will receive 200 million yuan
from the central government as subsidies for the 700 resettlers
there. The funds will be used in building infrastructure projects
in new villages and developing agriculture, thus promoting the
economic growth in the province.
