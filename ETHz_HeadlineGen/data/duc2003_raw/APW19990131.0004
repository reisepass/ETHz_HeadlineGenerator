	NEW YORK (AP) -- When Sotheby's sold a Harry S. Truman signature  
that turned out to be a reproduction, the prestigious auction house 
apologized and bought it back. 
	On the explosive frontier of Internet auctions, the policy is  
different: bidder beware. 
	Toy collector Christina Platthy says she found out too late --  
after paying $1,815 for a rare Beanie Baby she bought in an eBay 
Web site auction and getting a $5 stuffed duck instead. 
	The rapid, raucous popularity of Internet auction houses has  
left consumers prey to cyber-scams and emerging companies like eBay 
struggling to prevent a new kind of fraud. 
	The company, founded in 1995 by Pierre Omidyar in San Jose,  
Calif. to sell his girlfriend's Pez dispensers, is the most famous 
of the online auctioneers, but it has no less than 1,500 rivals. 
	Auction houses say they can't be forced to protect consumers  
against bogus buys, any more than a newspaper can be held 
responsible for the claims of its classified advertisers. 
	``I think from a legal point of view we have no liability,''  
said eBay CEO Meg Whitman. However, she added, ``We actually have a 
significant responsibility to make eBay as safe a site as possible 
to trade on. We also need to communicate that users have a 
responsibility as well.'' 
	Whitman says fraud is exceptionally rare among its 1 million  
users -- less than 1/100th of 1 percent of its 700,000 daily 
auctions. 
	But, many users report their problems elsewhere. The National  
Consumers League gets 600 complaints a month about Internet fraud. 
Two out of three are auction fraud cases. 
	As the largest auction house, eBay has had its share of mishaps.  
	Pennsylvanian Jamison Piatt was turned in by angry buyers who  
never got the Furby toys he promised. He's agreed to repay them 
$3,600. 
	Bidders aren't always honest either. Some offered up to $200,000  
for a ``Today'' show jacket signed by host Katie Couric. After 
bogus bids were ferreted out, the jacket sold for $11,400. Starting 
next month, deadbeat bidders will be suspended from eBay. 
	The problems may stem in part from the industry's stratospheric  
growth. 
	Market researcher Jupiter Communications estimates that the  
number of Internet auction customers will jump nearly sixfold from 
1.2 million to 6.5 million by 2000, when they will spend about $7.1 
billion. For eBay, sales grew 724 percent in 1998, to $47.4 
million. 
	As the industry grows, so does fraud. Cyber-scams are prevalent  
enough that Manhattan attorney Brian Brokate has a full-time staff 
tracking online knockoffs of luxury goods made by clients such as 
Rolex and Vuitton. 
	New York City is trying to hold online auction houses  
accountable. The city's Department of Consumer Affairs said last 
week it is looking into whether some eBay sellers are falsely 
labeling baseballs supposedly signed by such legends as Babe Ruth 
and Roberto Clemente, as ``one-of-a-kind.'' 
	Ms. Whitman says eBay's glad to cooperate, even though the city  
hasn't notified eBay of the probe. 
	In an acknowledgment that fraud is a problem, eBay said earlier  
this month it would guarantee items from $25 to $200. 
	That doesn't help high bidders like Ms. Platthy.  
	She says she paid for a rare ``Quackers'' Beanie manufactured  
without wings, but got a cheaper version with the wings obviously 
cut off. Seller Mark R. Mills of Las Vegas, who was ejected from 
eBay last year, responds: ``She got what she paid for.'' 
	Ms. Platthy wants New York officials to force eBay to vouch for  
its sellers. 
	``I'm glad that they're trying to crack down on them,'' she  
said, adding that Mills didn't give her his real name. ``The person 
I was dealing with did not exist. That's what irritates me about 
eBay. They don't check anything.'' 
	The best way for auction house customers to protect themselves  
is to use an escrow service that will hold onto their check until 
the auctioned item is received in good condition, said eBay's Ms. 
Whitman. The company makes that easy by offering online links to 
escrow companies. The catch: a 5 percent fee. 
	``Eighteen-hundred dollars is a lot of money and using escrow is  
probably a pretty smart thing to do when you are dealing with that 
kind of money,'' Ms. Whitman said. 
	Brokate concedes that online auctioneers probably can't be held  
legally responsible unless they're informed of a specific fraud and 
refuse to act. He said eBay has been quick to help so far. 
	Two traditional auction houses could shake up the industry with  
their plans to go online later this year. 
	Sotheby's says its items will be guaranteed and its rival  
Christie's is expected to follow suit. 
	``We believe that a collector ... needs to have the assurance  
that experts have properly assessed what is being sold and that 
that item is being guaranteed,'' said David Redden, executive vice 
president of Sotheby's.
