Nairobi, February 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. special envoy Jesse
Jackson urged Monday Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi during
their talks to visit Rift Valley Province in a bid to end tribal
clashes there killing some 120 people since January 11.
"The president's presence, personal presence and touch, will
show a humane expression of care across lines, party, ethnic
lines," said Jackson, U.S. President Bill Clinton's envoy for
democracy in Africa, following a morning meeting with Moi.
He told reporters following a morning meeting with Moi that he
believes Moi might visit the violent province as early as this
week.
He said that a joint visit by Moi and opposition leader Mwai
Kibaki would provide a useful symbol of ethnic and political
unity of the eastern African country.
Meanwhile, he noted that "the United States is deeply
concerned by the outbreaks of ethnically-based violence in the
Rift Valley in recent weeks."
His two-day visit starting Sunday "reflects the importance the
U.S. attaches to the continued development of democracy in
Kenya," Jackson said.
Four people were seriously wounded and 17 houses were burned
out when raiders attacked Lorian Saturday night, forcing hundreds
of scared families to flee the area.
The ruling Kenya African National Union and the opposition
accuse each other of inciting violence mainly between the largest
Kenyan tribe of Kikuyu and Moi's home tribe Kalenjin.
Local press said many of the early victims of the violence
appeared to be Kikuyus, but that Kalenjin people now turned out
to account for half of the dead.
Jackson toured three hospitals hosting clash victims in Nakuru
of the Rift Valley Province Sunday. The town is an epicenter of
the clashes shocking the whole east African state.
He left here this afternoon for the Democratic Republic of
Congo and Liberia.
Local press say his visits are part of preparations for
Clinton's visit to Africa due in March.
