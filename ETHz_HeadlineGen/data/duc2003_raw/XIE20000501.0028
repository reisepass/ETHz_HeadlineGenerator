UNITED NATIONS, May 1 (Xinhua) -- A small but crucial cost item
in the 450 million U.S. dollar appeal for Mozambique this week is
15 million U.S. dollars for measures to reduce the southern
African country's vulnerability to floods, droughts and tropical
cyclones.
In a press release issued here Monday, the U.N. Development
Program (UNDP) said that a disaster reduction strategy in the
package for presentation to the International Reconstruction
Conference, slated for May 3-4 in Rome, includes the improvement
of meteorological forecast capabilities combined with more
effective monitoring of water levels and currents in the main
rivers.
The aim is to create an integrated flood warning system that
includes not only early warning mechanisms but also contingency
disaster plans, improved local communication and education for
populations living in high-risk areas.
"Regional cooperation is another crucial element in disaster
prevention and mitigation because several of the major rivers in
Southern Africa flow into Mozambique from neighboring countries,"
said Emmanuel Dierckx de Casterle, UNDP resident representative in
Mozambique.
Environmental impact studies will analyze land use in disaster
prone communities. Some 80 percent of the flood-affected families
this year depend on agriculture and fishing for their livelihood.
In some cases, water and farmlands have been contaminated by
the floods. Studies will therefore identify new residential areas
for the affected population.
The UNDP and the World Food Program have already initiated a
support program for the Mozambican National Institute for Disaster
Management.
The UNDP's Emergency Response Division (ERD) assists
governments in assessing vulnerability to crises and natural
disasters, and in establishing early-warning systems and
contingency plans.
The ERD also helps governments to integrate disaster
preparedness, mitigation and prevention into national development
programs.
Mozambique is highly vulnerable to natural disasters caused by
extreme weather patterns. Floods and droughts hit the country
throughout the 1980s and 1990s, but no disaster in memory was as
destructive and abrupt as the flooding in February and March of
this year.
"The reconstruction challenge facing Mozambique in the
aftermath of this year's flooding is the biggest since the end of
the civil war," Casterle said.
Although many disaster victims have now returned to their
hometowns, more than half a million people need to be resettled.
The objective is to resettle them in safe areas, provide temporary
shelter and facilitate the building of permanent housing.
