   GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner
John Swofford will be the coordinator for the Bowl Championship
Series this season.
   He will replace Southeastern Conference commissioner Roy Kramer,
who has served as coordinator since the BCS began in 1998, the ACC
said Wednesday.
   The BCS is the six-conference confederation designed to
determine an NCAA Division I-A champion. The BCS will release its
standings through the National Football Foundation, with the first
installment Oct. 23.
   The BCS was created to match the two best teams -- based on its
standings that use The Associated Press and USA Today/ESPN polls,
computers and strength of schedule -- in a national title game. The
four bowls participating in the BCS are the Sugar, Orange, Fiesta
and Rose.
   ABC has agreed to televise the BCS through the 2005 season.
