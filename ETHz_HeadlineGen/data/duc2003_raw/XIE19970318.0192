BUDAPEST, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic and Hungary
will not compete with each other in their bids to join NATO and
the European Union (EU), the Hungarian Telegraph Agency reported
today.
Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, who is on a one-day visit
to Hungary, said after meeting Hungarian Prime Minister Horn Gyula
that the two countries shared the same interests over joining NATO
and the EU.
The leaders of the Czech Republic and Hungary will continue to
strengthen political dialog on their participation in European
integration, Klaus added.
The Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland are the favorites to be
the first countries to join NATO as part of the military
alliance's eastward expansion plan.
During their meeting, Horn said he hoped Hungary's trade
deficit with the Czech Republic would fall.
The two countries agreed to strengthen cooperation in health
care, welfare, culture and education.
Hungarian President Arpad Goncz and President of the National
Assembly Zoltan Gal also held talks with Klaus.
