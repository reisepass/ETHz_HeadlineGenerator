   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Charlie Brown, Lucy and Linus were missing,
but Snoopy was there to play crew boss for assorted dignitaries at
this week's groundbreaking for the Charles M. Schulz Museum and
Research Center.
   With organizers promising the $8 million museum will be
completed in 14 months, Schulz's wife, Jeannie, and others donned
hard hats and spooned soil with golden shovels Thursday to launch
the project.
   Jeannie Schulz said she hoped the museum honoring the Peanuts
creator's life also would prove beneficial to his adopted hometown.
   ``I really think it's going to be a mecca for all the Peanuts'
fans, and I think it's going to be wonderful for Santa Rosa,'' she
said.
   The stated mission of the museum is to preserve and interpret
Schulz's work over 50 years of drawing the comic strip, examining
his inspirations and influences, and building an understanding of
cartoonists and their art form.
   Museum board member Lucy Shelton Caswell, curator of the Cartoon
Research Library at the University of Ohio, said it's critical to
keep his legacy alive.
   ``I think people don't realize how innovative Schulz was, and
how many things he did new, first,'' Caswell said. Among other
contributions, she said, ``he made it OK to talk about failings and
anxieties.''
   The 27,384-square-foot museum has been in the works for more
than two years and Schulz had hoped construction could start last
fall to mark the beginning of Peanuts' 50th year. But the project
was delayed several months and Schulz, who was diagnosed with
cancer in November, did not survive to see the groundbreaking. He
died in February, the day before his last comic strip ran.
   Designed by C. David Robinson Architects of San Francisco, the
museum will include a 100-seat theater, classrooms and large
galleries with both permanent and temporary exhibits.
