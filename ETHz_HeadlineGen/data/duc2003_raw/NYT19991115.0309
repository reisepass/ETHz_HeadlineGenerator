   HOUSTON _ The fourth of six gyroscopes aboard the orbiting
Hubble Space Telescope has faltered, forcing an abrupt halt to all
celestial observations and lending new urgency to a December space
shuttle repair mission, NASA said Monday.
   Spacewalking astronauts have trained to replace all six of the
gyroscopes and make other repairs during the 10-day flight of the
shuttle Discovery. The shuttle is to lift off with a crew of seven,
including a quartet of spacewalkers, on Dec. 6.
   Saturday's failure left the 13-ton, 43-foot long telescope with
only two operable gyroscopes. At least three are required to carry
out observations of stars, galaxies and other celestial phenomena.
   The high-revving gyroscopes are among the most crucial
components of the telescope's pointing system, which enables
ground-based astronomers to aim and lock the space telescope onto
distant, faint objects for lengthy observations.
   Anticipating additional gyroscope losses, NASA in March
announced an unscheduled servicing call by shuttle astronauts,
weeks after a third Hubble gyroscope faltered. The gyroscopes were
designed for periodic replacement. NASA places the gyroscope
replacement portion of the upcoming $205 million mission at $8
million.
   The next scheduled shuttle visit to Hubble had been planned for
mid-2000. Initially, the agency planned to move the flight to
mid-October, but that changed with the July launching of the
shuttle Columbia with the Chandra X-ray Observatory.
   Moments after liftoff, Columbia experienced an electrical short
that was traced to insulation damage on internal wiring. The
finding forced a suspension of all shuttle flights until Discovery,
Endeavour, Atlantis and Columbia could be inspected and repaired.
   Discovery was towed to its launch pad at NASA's Kennedy Space
Center in Florida on Saturday.
   Meanwhile, the latest gyroscope failure forced the space
telescope into an electronic slumber called a ``safe mode.'' The
operating mode ensures that the telescope continues to generate
electricity for its scientific equipment and flight controls,
though it is unable to point at celestial targets.
   The gyroscope stopped after experiencing a sudden power surge.
The previous failures followed successive electrical
irregularities, some spanning several weeks.
   ``This underscores the wisdom of scheduling this call-up service
mission,'' said David Leckrone, the Hubble's senior project
scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.,
where the observatory is managed. ``We will only lose about three
weeks of science observations. Had we not split the mission and
proceeded with our June 2000 mission we would be facing a
seven-month interruption.''
   In addition to replacing all six gyroscopes next month,
spacewalking astronauts plan to install a faster flight computer, a
solid state data recorder, a new transmitter, another large
guidance device as well as new external insulation.
