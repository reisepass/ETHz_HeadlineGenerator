   The comic strips in the nation's newspapers today were supposed
to be a surprise for one special man.
   At their convention last year in San Antonio, members of the
National Cartoonists Society hatched a loving prank. Charles M.
Schulz's ``Peanuts'' would mark its 50th anniversary in 2000, and
``Sparky'' himself would get a lifetime achievement award. What if,
on the morning of that convention, Schulz picked up the newspapers
to check out his friends' strips and discovered that every one of
them was a tribute to him and ``Peanuts''?
   ``We knew we wanted to honor him for the 50th anniversary;
something extra-special,'' said cartoonist Patrick McDonnell, who
draws ``Mutts'' and who proposed the idea to the NCS board.
``Because he loved comic strips so much, if he saw the whole comic
section talking about `Peanuts,' I knew he'd get a kick out of
it.''
   Fate had other plans. Schulz fell ill in December, found out he
had cancer and retired. He died at his home in Santa Clara, Calif.,
the night before the last ``Peanuts'' was published, on Feb. 13.
   Today in New York, the NCS convention is in full swing; tonight
the winners of the society's annual awards, the Reubens, will be
disclosed. And ``Sparky'' Schulz's widow, Jeannie, will accept the
Milton Caniff Lifetime Achievement Award on his behalf.
   Schulz had hoped to be able to collect the award himself, but he
never learned of his friends' other tribute, said Atlanta
Constitution editorial cartoonist Mike Luckovich, who organized the
yearlong project. ``When people see these, they'll get a feeling of
how much Schulz meant to so many cartoonists,'' Luckovich said.
``He was a giant inspiration.''
   Nearly 100 cartoonists participated in the project. More than 80
of the tribute strips are posted at www.snoopy.com. And eventually,
you'll be able to see the original drawings at the Charles M.
Schulz museum being built near his studio in Santa Clara.
   ``Charles Schulz is the reason I became a cartoonist,''
McDonnell said. ``He inspired a whole generation. Everybody loved
him.''
