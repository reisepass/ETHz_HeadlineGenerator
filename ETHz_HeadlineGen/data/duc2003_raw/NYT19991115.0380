A federal judge yesterday temporarily blocked San Francisco's
voter-approved initiative barring banks from charging fees to
noncustomers who use their ATMs.
   U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker granted the banks' request for
a preliminary injunction, preventing the San Francisco ATM
surcharge ban from taking effect and prohibiting Santa Monica from
enforcing a similar ordinance that became effective last week.
   Without the injunction, the San Francisco law would have started
in December, 10 days after the Board of Supervisors certified
results of the November 2 initiative.
   The judge ruled that the banks had made a convincing case,
saying: ``The ordinances are likely to be invalidated as pre-empted
by federal law.''
   Bank of America and Wells Fargo Bank said they will restore ATM
service to noncustomers in Santa Monica now that they can levy
surcharges again. The two banks stopped letting anyone but account
holders use their 33 cash machines Thursday when that city's fee
ban took effect.
   BofA had said it would also cut off noncustomers in San
Francisco if the surcharge ban were enforced, a move that could
have made it more difficult for tourists and people visiting on
business to get cash. The court order blocking the ban removes that
threat.
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Long Court Battle Foreseen
   The ruling is the first step in what is expected to be a long
courtroom fight over the legality of the anti-surcharge measures.
Banks argue that federal law gives U.S. bank regulators sole
authority over the fee practices of nationally chartered banks,
pre-empting local law.
   Attorneys for San Francisco and Santa Monica say the federal law
governing ATMs _ the Electronic Funds Transfer Act _ specifically
gives states and localities the right to enact ATM consumer
protections.
   If the banks win the case, San Francisco's law would apply only
to a handful of ATMs operated by state-chartered financial
institutions.
   Federal appeals courts in the Northeast and Midwest, ruling on
ATM surcharge bans set by Connecticut and Iowa, have issued
contradictory opinions on the authority of state banking regulators
to ban ATM surcharges. Both cases avoided direct rulings on the
bans, which currently stand in both states.
   ``The law is a mess and needs to be clarified,'' said David
Bartone, a Washington, D.C., attorney specializing in ATM law.
   In the two weeks since San Francisco voters approved Proposition
F, outlawing ATM surcharges, the matter has moved to the front
burner politically as well as legally. New York City, New Orleans,
Los Angeles and about a dozen other cities across the nation are
considering similar ATM surcharge bans, and banks are preparing to
oppose the initiatives.
   The banks filed suit to block the San Francisco and Santa Monica
laws the day after the San Francisco election.
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Cutoff Called Scare Tactic
   Surcharge foes say the lawsuit and ATM cutoff of noncustomers
are designed to intimidate other states and localities that are
considering surcharge bans. ``They are attempting to scare off
other cities,'' said Stacy Mitchell, a banking specialist with the
Institute for Local Self-Reliance in Minneapolis.
   Fee critics also say that Bank of America's threat to stop
letting noncustomers use its ATMs in San Francisco may be a bluff.
That is because rules set by switching systems linking the cash
machines of different institutions, such as Visa's Plus and
MasterCard's Cirrus systems, limit the ability of a member bank to
take its ATMs out of the networks.
   The banks say they are defending their right to charge a
reasonable fee for a service to noncustomers. Any moves to limit
ATM use to their own customers would be within the rules, they say.
   At issue is one of two fees that customers typically pay when
they use a cash machine not belonging to their regular bank, thrift
or credit union.
   The first is the fee a financial institution charges its own
customers for using an outside ATM, typically $2 in California. The
second is the ATM surcharge that the outside ATM owner levies on
noncustomers who use its cash machines, typically $1.50 in the
state. The second fee is banned under the San Francisco and Santa
Monica laws.
   San Francisco voters approved Proposition F by a 2-to-1 ratio.
Santa Monica's City Council enacted its ban on October 12. The two
cities are the first in the country to ban ATM surcharges by
referendum or legislation.
