   ATLANTA _ The new system for selecting the two teams for college
football's national championship game is not perfect. But it's
certainly better than the methods used in the past, SEC
Commissioner Roy Kramer said Tuesday.
   Kramer, who also is the coordinator of the Bowl Championship
Series, unveiled a rating system that will include four components
to create what will be known as the BCS Standings. The top two
teams in the standings will advance to the national championship
game, which this season will be the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 4, 1999.
   The BCS is comprised of six major conferences and four major
bowls _ Fiesta, Sugar, Orange, and Rose. Each of the six conference
champs is guaranteed a slot in one of the bowls, with the top two
teams playing in a ``national championship'' game, which rotates to
a different bowl each year.
   In previous years the bowls have used only the two major polls _
which included the votes of sportswriters and coaches _ to pick the
teams for the national championship game. This new system
interjects more scientific information into the process, not unlike
the Ratings Percentage Index (RPI) used to help determine the field
for the NCAA men's basketball tournament.
   Problems still will exist. If there are three undefeated teams,
the BCS Standings would be used to leave one team out of the big
game. The same goes if there is only one unbeaten team and several
with one loss. The numbers will make the decision, and somebody is
not going to be happy.
   ``We simply felt that the time had come to get as much good
information into the process as we logically could,'' Kramer said.
``Like the polls, this system will have its flaws, and people will
argue about it. But it is an honest attempt to give the public what
it wants, and that's a true national championship game.''
   These standings, however, will determine the matchup for the
national championship game only. The other bowls will make their
selections from the remaining conference champions or at-large
teams that qualify by finishing in the top six of the standings.
   The top four in the final regular-season polls a year ago _
Michigan, Nebraska, Tennessee, and Florida State _ were the also
the top four under the BCS formula.
   Had the current system been in effect a year ago, Nebraska and
Michigan would have played for the national championship. But
Michigan was locked in to the Rose Bowl, where it beat Washington
State and eventually shared the national title with Nebraska, which
beat Tennessee in the Orange Bowl.
