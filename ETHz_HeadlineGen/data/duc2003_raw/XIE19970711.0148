NAIROBI, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Kenya has urged the U.S.
government to refrain from accusing it over the recent
confrontations between Kenyan police and opposition supporters,
according to local press reports today.
Kenyan Foreign Minister Kalonzo Musyoka said on thursday that
the Kenyan government took exception to a statement by U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright which claimed that the
current political violence in Kenya was caused by Nairobi's
"unacceptable strong-arm tactics."
It is becoming pretty obvious, the Kenyan minister said, the
opposition parties in the East African country are committed to
violence by all means.
"They are inciting violence to create the impression that
Kenya is in political crisis and shift the blame on the
government," he added.
Musyoka said that Kenya is a sovereign country and the U.S.
government could not dictate to Kenya over the internal affairs.
There was a definite foreign intervention in the recent
Kenyan confrontation and the opposition has been aided and
abetted by foreigners, he noted.
The minister said that Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi is
committed to peace and his doors are widely open though the
opposition is not interested in engaging in dialogue.
According to the minister, President Moi had barely a year ago
offered to meet with the opposition representatives at his
Harambee House in Nairobi but the opposition "refused to turn
up."
Meanwhile, President Moi said yesterday that the Opposition
had chosen violence to press for constitutional reforms in the country.
The Opposition is using the same strategy of violence as that
was adopted during the run-up to the General Elections in 1992,
when the Opposition instigated tribal clashes in the Rift Valley
Province in order to have political agenda, the president said.
The kenyan president accused some foreign countries of imposing
different types of democracy on African countries, saying that
every country should be left alone to devise its own form of
democracy suitable to the local situation.
