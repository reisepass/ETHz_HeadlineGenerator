   A sweeping national study of homeless people served by shelters,
soup kitchens and other programs found that almost half were in
their first episode of homelessness, 44 percent had worked at least
part time in the previous month, and 42 percent said that what they
needed more than anything was help finding a job.
   But the study, based on Census Bureau surveys in 1995 and 1996
and the most comprehensive study of homelessness ever, also found
that over all, the homeless were deeply impoverished and most were
ill. Two-thirds were suffering from chronic or infectious diseases,
not counting AIDS, 55 percent were without health insurance and 39
percent had signs of mental illness. Twenty-seven percent reported
a childhood history of foster care or institutional placement.
   ``This is a definitive description of what we're dealing with
when we talk about the quote, unquote, homeless,'' Andrew Cuomo,
secretary of housing and urban development, said on Tuesday in
discussing the study, which was based on interviews with 12,000
service providers and 4,000 homeless clients. ``There is no simple
solution.''
   Despite their handicaps, 60 percent of the homeless living alone
and 76 percent of those living in families successfully left
shelters for permanent housing when they received the services they
needed, including housing subsidies, health care, substance-abuse
treatment, education and job training, according to the study's
surveys of representatives of about 40,000 programs that serve the
homeless nationwide.
   While the study did not offer an estimate of the overall
homeless population, its 600 pages of statistics included figures
showing that an estimated 470,000 homeless people sheltered on an
average night in February 1996 were only a quarter of the people
who were homeless at any one time during the year. The previous
national survey, done in 1987, estimated the number of homeless
people, including those in the streets, at 500,000 to 600,000 on
any night.
   The study took three years to complete because it required the
collection and analysis of an extraordinary amount of data and
involved 12 federal agencies, officials said.
   Experts on homelessness, including Martha Burt, the director of
social service research at the Urban Institute, which prepared the
report to be released by the housing department on Tuesday,
cautioned that like any point-in-time snapshot, this survey
over-represents the more chronically homeless, who are more likely
to be mentally ill or addicted to drugs, and under-represents the
people who become homeless sporadically for economic reasons.
   ``They are bookends,'' Cuomo agreed. ``You have a pent up need
for affordable housing and you have populations with underlying
problems _ they are both driving the system.''
   At a time when cities around the country are using law
enforcement to move homeless people out of public places, Cuomo
added, the study underlines that punitive ordinances and police
crackdowns will not work.
   ``You need outreach to get people off the street _ not a police
officer with handcuffs,'' he said. ``You need transitional services
as a second step, and then by definition you need the third step,
which is permanent housing.''
   Among the surprises in the study was that while New York, Los
Angeles and other larger cities provided the most beds for the
homeless, they helped a smaller portion of their poor residents
than some smaller cities like Minneapolis, San Francisco and St.
Louis.
   Despite the booming economy, Ms. Burt said, there is no reason
to believe the picture drawn by the study has changed
significantly. The poverty rate remains almost the same, and other
Housing Department studies show that rising rents and a steep
decline in housing subsidies have left 5.3 million poor families in
housing that was unaffordable or severely substandard _ a record
number.
   ``The economy is better but we are also cutting way back on the
safety net,'' Ms. Burt said. ``This is poverty-related as well as
disability-related. Lots of people have problems; we have alcoholic
senators _ they're not homeless.''
   Homeless people are among the poorest in the nation, with
incomes averaging half the federal poverty level. Forty percent of
those surveyed said they went without food one or more days in the
previous month, compared to 3 percent of other poor Americans.
Almost a third of all homeless clients surveyed said that they had
slept on the streets or in other places not meant for habitation
within the week before the survey. Yet, those in central cities
were better off than their counterparts surveyed in 1987, mainly
because they were more likely to have government benefits like
public assistance and food stamps.
   ``The fact that most of these folks don't have Medicaid is a
pretty damning statistic,'' said Dennis P. Culhane, a professor of
social welfare policy at the University of Pennsylvania. The rates
of mental illness were unchanged since the 1987 survey, a fact,
Culhane added, that suggests known solutions to the homelessness of
the disabled _ treatment and supportive, permanent housing _ are
not being fully used.
   The survey shows the strengths of the expanded system of
homeless services, largely provided by non-profit and
religious-based charities financed by the government, Culhane said,
but also shows the limits of that approach.
   Exploring the suspicion in many towns that the homeless come
from somewhere else, the study found that 29 percent of homeless
families and 46 percent of single homeless clients said they were
not living in the same place where they became homeless. In all
cases, Ms. Burt said, they had moved from a smaller place to a
bigger one.
   Major reasons included the lack of jobs and affordable housing
in the place they left, and the presence of relatives or friends
and job possibilities in the city or town where they were
interviewed, as well as the availability of shelters, missions and
other services.
   Serious childhood traumas were common among the homeless people
surveyed, the study found, with 25 percent reporting childhood
abuse, 33 percent having run away from home, and 21 percent having
experienced homelessness as children.
   ``I think what you also see in this report is the failure of our
primary, early intervention system,'' Cuomo said. ``You are
creating tomorrow's homeless today.''
