	   ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar (AP) -- Madagascar's battle against a cholera
epidemic is being complicated by a spat between the government of one of the
world's poorest countries and an acclaimed international aid agency.
	   More than 1,000 Malagasies -- as residents of this Indian Ocean island are
called -- have died since the epidemic erupted a year ago, according to official
figures. Most health officials believe the death toll is higher, even as the
government said Wednesday the epidemic is ``diminishing.''
	   In a battle on the sidelines, the Swiss section of Doctors Without Borders
announced Tuesday it was abandoning its cholera-fighting operations in the
country because the government refused it access to victims.
	   ``The reason they gave (was) `We the people of Madagascar can care for our
own population,''' said Thomas Nierle, a Doctors Without Borders official. ``I
think it's a question of sovereignty. It's a lot of pride. It's almost
arrogant.''
	   The government, for its part, made a similar accusation against Doctors
Without Borders, which won the Nobel Peace Prize last year for bringing medical
aid to conflict areas worldwide.
	   ''(Doctors Without Borders) has treated us like a war-torn country with no
ability to conduct its own health initiatives, dictating what we do,'' Armand
Ralaidovy, the Health Ministry's coordinator for combating cholera, said in an
interview. ``Their statement was derogatory.''
	   ``We have more than 2,000 doctors. We have the health infrastructure,'' he
said.
	   Ralaidovy said the government was ably handling the epidemic. But some of
the criticism has come from Madagascar's own doctors.
	   On Tuesday, a local association of doctors known by its French acronym
SEDODIA called for Heath Minister Henriette Rahantalalao to resign, saying she
was bungling the handling of the epidemic.
	   Soon after the epidemic broke out, the Ministry of Defense erected
roadblocks on major highways. All travelers were required to take heavy doses of
oral antibiotics in a move many critics said was ineffective and even dangerous.
Giving antibiotics to those without cholera serves no purpose, and raises the
general population's resistance to the drugs.
	   The roadblocks were taken down on Nov. 26, but were put back up a few weeks
ago and only travelers complaining of diarrhea were then given the antibiotics.
	   This Texas-sized island off southeast Africa is known to the 100,000-plus
tourists who visit annually for its unspoiled beaches, virgin rain forests and
sightings of lemurs and humpback whales. But behind the pristine attractions lie
poverty and unsanitary living conditions -- a breeding ground for cholera.
	   Only one in three people have access to clean water in Madagascar, the 13th
poorest nation on the planet. Only 3 percent have access to flush toilets. Most
even lack the money to buy charcoal to boil water, a critical step in preventing
cholera, an acute intestinal infection that causes copious diarrhea, which can
quickly lead to dehydration and death.
	   On Wednesday, 16 patients with severe diarrhea checked into the dim,
run-down Befelatanana Hospital in Antananarivo. A crowded roomful of listless
men, women and children were laid out on cots with IV cords dangling above them.
	   A notice in an office around the corner reminded medical personnel to
require relatives to take special precautions in burying the bodies of cholera
victims, to prevent more infections.
	   Doctors said about 50 cholera patients were in the hospital, down from more
than 100 in recent weeks.
	   The Health Ministry said Wednesday the worst of the epidemic was over.
	   ``The outbreak has peaked and now is diminishing because of our
interventions,'' Ralaidovy said in an interview.
	   But Nierle, who recently completed a 13-month tour of duty in Madagascar and
was interviewed by phone from Geneva, said there were no signs the epidemic was
slowing.
	   A total of 18,809 suspected cholera cases have been identified in the past
year in Madagascar, the government said. A reported 1,070 people have died.
