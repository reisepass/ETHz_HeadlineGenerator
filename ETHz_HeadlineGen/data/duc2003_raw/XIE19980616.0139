NEW DELHI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee and his Bangladesh counterpart, Sheikh Hasina,
held wide-ranging talks here Tuesday on matters of mutual interest
for boosting the ties between their two countries, official
sources said here.
Vajpayee held one-to-one talks with Hasina, who arrived here
Tuesday morning on a one-day visit to India, followed by
delegation-level discussions on issues covering trade, investment,
tariff concessions and cooperation in various fields, the sources
said.
Hasina is the first chief of government to visit India after it
conducted five underground nuclear tests on May 11 and 13 this
year.
Shortly after her arrival, Hasina had a meeting with India's
former Prime Minister I. K. Gujral, who established good
neighborly relations with India's neighbors.
A spokesman of the Indian Foreign Office said here Monday that
Hasina's visit had nothing to do with Indo-Pakistan relations and
it was purely a bilateral event. India is opposed to any third
party mediation in Indo-Pak matters.
