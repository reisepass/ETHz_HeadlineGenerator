   _ The computer industry has known about the Y2K problem since
the early 1980s, but only began working on the problem in 1996.
   _ An estimated 150 million microchips could be problematic.
   _ One estimate puts the worldwide cost of correcting the Y2K
problem at $600 billion.
   _ Most products bought from 1997 on should be Y2K compliant.
   _ Apple Computer's Macintosh is immune to the Y2K bug.
   _ To determine if your computer is Y2K compliant, set your
system clock to 11:55 p.m., Dec. 31, 1999. Turn it off and then
back on 15 minutes later. If the date is shown as Jan. 1, 2000,
your system is Y2K compliant.
   _ Some estimate the Y2K problem will generate $100 billion in
litigation costs alone.
   _ As of Nov. 13, 61 percent of the federal government's computer
systems deemed ``mission critical'' had been repaired and tested.
   _ Small businesses may be the hardest hit by the Y2K problem.
About 330,000 small businesses may have to close until a technician
is available to solve the problems, and 370,000 others could be
incapacitated.
