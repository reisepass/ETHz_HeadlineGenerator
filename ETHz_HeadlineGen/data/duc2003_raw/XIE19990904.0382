MAPUTO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's National Union of
Cashew Workers Friday called on the Assembly or parliament to pass
a bill for protecting the cashew processing industry by banning,
for a 10-year period, the export of raw cashew nuts.
General secretary of the union, Boaventura Mondlane, said at a
press conference in Maputo that the government's policy of
liberalizing the trade in cashews, imposed by the World Bank, had
led to the almost total paralysis of the local processing
industry.
Mondlane said that the great majority of cashew processing
workers are out of a job because of this.
Liberalization "did not consider any balance between trade and
industry, but prioritized the export of raw nuts at the expense of
the national processing industry," Mondlane pointed out.
He noted the liberalization process would "leave thousands of
workers unemployed, waste the investments that have already been
made, and discourage new investment in the sector."
He stressed that his union fully supports the bill before
parliament because "it seeks to save the industry, by prioritizing
the supply of cashews to the factories and it will promote just
prices for the producers, protect the workers' rights, and create
a climate of tranquillity for new investments in the sector."
The raw nuts were exported to India, and the local processing
factories found themselves starved of raw materials.
"We want a suspension of raw nut exports," said Mondlane.
Mondlane argued that if the Assembly rejects the cashew bill
presented by some deputies of the ruling Mozambique Liberation
Front Party (FRELIMO), or fails to debate it, "it will be losing a
major opportunity."
Mondlane said that the National Union of Cashew Workers is
ready to stage demonstrations in all the main cashew centers, but
he declined to give any further details.
The workers, he said, would make their dissatisfaction known to
the Assembly.
