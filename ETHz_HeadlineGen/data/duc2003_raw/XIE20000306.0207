LUSAKA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's parliament has set up a
parliamentary committee to raise funds and other materials for
flood victims in Mozambique, a senior parliamentarian said.
"The Zambian parliament members have responded to the call to
help our brothers and sisters in Mozambique and so far a committee
has been set up to raise money for the flood victims," said Vernon
Mwaanga, parliamentary chief of the ruling Movement for
Multi-Party Democracy (MMD).
The parliamentarians found it prudent to help alleviate the
sufferings of the people in the flood-hit Mozambique, the Times of
Zambia newspaper Monday quoted Mwaanga as saying lately.
The money would be deposited in the SOS-Mozambique account and
other materials would be directed to the SOS-Mozambique committee
headed by Sebastian Kopulande, former Zambian Permanent Secretary
at State House.
Mwaanga also commended the government for donating 120 tons of
food and medical aid worth over one million U.S. dollars to the
displaced people in Mozambique.
He said the government's response was in line with the
resolutions of the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
emergency meeting, compelling all member countries to be involved
in the Mozambique situation.
The 14-member SADC was also working on long-term plans to
rebuild infrastructures after the Cyclone Eline-induced floods.
Mozambique has been hit by devastating floods for the past
three weeks. Reportedly, about two million people have been
displaced.
