   ATLANTA _ Auctioning on the Internet is one of the
fastest-growing forms of electronic commerce, on a pace to reach
$40 billion a year, according to some experts.
   Singularly successful eBay, already a legend on Wall Street, is
raising some $1.11 billion in part to spur its international
expansion in the business of selling a huge range of goods.
   Its site on the Internet is a favorite for the sale, through a
bidding process, of items as varied as antiques, coins,
collectibles, computers, stamps and toys of all kinds.
   ``From a consumer standpoint, auction activity on the Internet
has been particularly successful in moving used goods,'' said David
Lucking-Reiley, a specialist in auction activity at Vanderbilt
University.
   The popularity of auctioning _ part commerce, part entertainment
_ has attracted other players on the Internet, including some who
have built their names in other spheres. For instance, Amazon.com,
well known for its success in moving books and records, is
assembling partners and the assets needed to get into the auction
business.
   Also, Yahoo.com, one of the most successful portals that greet
Internet visitors of all kinds, contemplates expanded activity in
auctioning, according to specialists in the industry. Meanwhile,
even as consumers are drawn to auctioning, other firms are tackling
potentially even more lucrative selling, including
business-to-business auctioning of industrial equipment and
materials.
   Onsale Inc., which has had success in commercial and consumers
sales, is teaming up with VerticalNet, a major player in industrial
sales, with some 20 separate sites on the Internet.
   Even as some auctions on the Web tout their global reach and
international potential, AuctionAtlanta, a newcomer, plans to
exploit its local connections and flavor. Holding out the prospect
that potential buyers will be able to inspect goods before bidding,
AuctionAtlanta launched an effort last week to sell such big-ticket
items as cars, boats and computer equipment by using the bidding
process.
   For the small consumer, the magic of the auctioning process,
experts say, is the ability to find items they would not ordinarily
be able to locate without years of hit-or-miss searching.
   ``In a way, the auctioning is like a new form of classified
advertising,'' said Lucking-Reiley. ``But the reach and scope of
the auctioning helps to make markets in a variety of goods.''
   Specifically, the process makes possible the pricing of rare
goods and, from the consumer's point of view, helps establish some
sense of what is affordable or not. Thus, the person holding a
garage sale now can attract better prices than the single offers
for prized chairs or tables, and likewise people who would
ordinarily consign items to a single small shop now can sample a
broadly-based appetite for goods.
   While most new items can probably be expected to move faster
through the warehouse selling now popular in electronics and other
goods, the discreet used-products market probably will find a home
in the Web sites, many of which will likely specialize.
   Lucking-Reily and his Vanderbilt colleagues operate a Web site
that helps educate surfers in the economics of electronic commerce,
including auctioning. It's at www.market.econ.vanderbilt.edu
   Among the variety of Web sites: eBay.com, Haggle Online, Auction
Central, One.Web Place, City Auction _ all mostly dedicated to used
consumer items of various kinds.
