   LOS ANGELES _ To the U.S. Census Bureau, in the year 2000 there
will no longer be homeless people _ only those without conventional
housing.
   Living in a car? Unconventional. A cardboard box?
Unconventional. Two or three families in one apartment?
Unconventional.
   Despite the use of government-speak in describing the living
conditions of the homeless, it is a serious question that troubles
homeless advocates and Los Angeles officials.
   For them, it's a multimillion-dollar question of how much state
and federal money will come to the city after the 2000 census.
   ``The general consensus is that the 1990 census was a disaster
in counting the homeless,'' said Doug Ring, a commissioner on the
Los Angeles Homeless Service Authority, a city-county joint agency
that deals with homeless people and their issues.
   ``And what that means is a significant reduction in the amount
of funding that comes to Los Angeles and other cities in the
county,'' he said.
   Natalie Profant, LAHSA planning manager, said her organization
has been working with the Census Bureau to try to develop better
ways to count the homeless.
   ``In 1990, they had the idea to go to encampments,'' Profant
said. ``The idea that you identify a site and you count the people
there is unrealistic, because not everyone who is homeless is going
to be there.
   ``And they had another problem. The people they hired had to go
to these spots at 2 in the morning and count people, which is very
frightening,'' she said.
   Since it was difficult to get workers to go into certain areas
at that hour, officials were unsure if they got an adequate count,
she said.
   Profant also is concerned about the agency's decision not to
identify the homeless as such.
   ``What they are doing is measuring poverty levels rather than
(individuals) as homeless,'' Profant said, adding she wants to see
as many homeless people counted as possible.
   LAHSA estimates there are 84,500 homeless in Los Angeles County
_ about the equivalent of the population of Whittier, Calif.
   LAHSA is working on a demonstration project to be unveiled in
January on other ways to count the homeless to make sure they are
included in the next national headcount.
   Census Bureau officials say they want to cooperate.
   Maria Mochulski, Census Bureau staff assistant and coordinator
for the program, said the agency has been working with service
providers such as shelters and soup kitchens to try to develop a
comprehensive program.
   ``As you might expect, the homeless are a key group that tends
to get missed in a census,'' Mochulski said. ``We are putting a lot
of thought into our planning and hope to use the homeless
themselves to help us. The key to getting a good count is to have
the homeless themselves and advocacy groups get involved.''
   Recently, the bureau did a pilot program in Sacramento,
targeting outdoor locations, shelters and other programs used by
the homeless to make a sample count.
   ``We are still evaluating that and hope it proves successful,''
she said.
   As for the bureau not acknowledging the homeless, Mochulski said
effective categorization presents a difficult question.
   ``It's a policy question and deals with definitions,'' Mochulski
said. ``The homeless aren't just the people on the street or living
in cars. It's people doubling and tripling up because they can't
afford their own place or people living in substandard housing.''
   There are other forms of housing that the bureau does recognize,
such as those who live on boats permanently or travel the country
in recreational vehicles.
   ``We have a separate marina unit, and we also check in at RV
campgrounds,'' Mochulski said. ``This survey is not only about
population, but about population and housing.'' &QL;
