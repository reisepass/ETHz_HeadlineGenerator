WASHINGTON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
considering to create a standby force of African troops to deal
with what it called humanitarian crises in Africa such as the
ongoing tribal warfare in Burundi and the civil war in Liberia,
U.S. officials have said.
U.S. senior officials have been consulting extensively with
European and African nations this week on the possible formation
of an "African Crisis Response Force", the officials said on
Friday night.
The issue is expected to be a main topic on the agenda of
Secretary of State Warren Christopher when he made a five-nation
visit to Africa early next month.
During his visit to Mali, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Angola and
South Africa, Christopher will discuss ways in which African
countries can respond more effectively the crisis situations on
the continent.
The officials said that planning for the force has been
accelerated by the ongoing crisis in Burundi, where tribal
warfare has led to the deaths of more than 150,000 people since
1993.
A civil war in Liberia has led to heavy loss of life since
1989 despite the presence of a West African peacekeeping force.
The United States has said a well-trained, well-equipped
force would have been far more effective in bringing about an
early solution.
The U.S. officials said the manpower of the force would be
provided by African nations while donor nations would contribute
training, equipment and logistical help.
Assistant Secretary of State George Moose and Susan Rice, the
National Security Council official in charge of Africa, are
discussing the Africa response force concept on an African trip
that including stops in Egypt, Tanzania, Gabon, Kenya, Uganda,
Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, Senegal, Ghana and Male, the officials said.
Another team of U.S. officials has been discussing the same
issue with Britain, France, Ireland, The Netherlands, Belgium
and Germany during their travel to Europe.
