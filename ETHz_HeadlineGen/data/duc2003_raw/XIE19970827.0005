LONDON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The European single currency euro
will go ahead on schedule on January 1, 1999 with a broad
membership, according to a survey of some prominent British
economists.
The survey, carried out by the pro-European pressure group
named European Movement, revealed that a majority of those polled
agree that the single currency to be broadly successful, but none
of them expects Britain to join the European Monetary Union (EMU)
in the first wave.
Those who believe that the EMU will be a success cite low
interest rates, low unemployment and low inflation as benefits of
the planned single currency.
Fears of a single currency failure focus on the reduction of
monetary flexibility and the risk that the European Central Bank
will set interest rates too high.
Director of the European Movement Stephen Woodard said, "The
single currency debate in this country has suffered from too much
ill-informed speculation and too little fact."
sooddard called on Britain to make various preparations and
rational debates on the single currency as "the single currency is
going to happen."
"If Britain is to make up its mind on this crucial issue, it
must be discussed in an informed way, free from prejudice and
hype," he added.
