   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Grassroots community organizers battling the
Y2K bug say the federal government and corporate America are
undermining their efforts with a flurry of ``don't worry, we'll
have everything fixed'' messages.
   A May survey of 100 local organizers in 28 states shows Y2K
activists fear confusing national readiness messages will only make
matters worse.
   Press statements from the president's Y2K council, for example,
say the nation's telephone system will work, but then adds that
1,400 small telephone companies could run into problems.
   And comparing Y2K to a bad winter storm is ``false, misleading
and creating a dangerous sense of complacency,'' activist David
Sunfellow said Tuesday in testimony before the Senate's special Y2K
committee.
   ``These are not facts but public Valium,'' Kerry Brock, director
of broadcasting for the Media Studies Center, told the Senate
committee.
   Other evidence coming from big business also does not fit neatly
into the everything-will-be-fixed mold.
   ``We are at the point (with Y2K) where almost everybody says
everything is under control,'' said Capers Jones, a leading Y2K
expert. ``But that does not mean that everything is under
control.''
Health-care watch
   One of the biggest Y2K question marks still looming in the
United States is the health-care industry, where those testing
biomedical devices are reporting conflicting results.
   Some hospitals testing devices listed on the Food and Drug
Administration's Web site as being Y2K-ready are finding they
malfunction when dates are advanced to Jan. 1.
   That has prompted the General Accounting Office, the federal
government's watchdog agency, to press regulators to verify claims
of Y2K readiness by device manufacturers. Up until Tuesday, the
Food and Drug Administration said it lacked the resources to do
such testing.
   Now officials plan to audit the data of 60 ``high risk'' device
manufacturers that could threaten patient health and safety, said
the Food and Drug Administration's William Hubbard in testimony
before a joint House committee.
   That comes as good news to Joel Willemssen, the General
Accounting Office's Y2K expert.
   ``We continue to believe that organizations such as the FDA can
provide medical device users with a greater level of confidence
that their equipment is Y2K compliant,'' Willemssen said.
   But the FDA's Hubbard remains unconvinced that potential device
problems will be significant or widespread.
   ``There will be specific problems that need corrections,'' he
said in written testimony. ``However, the current assessment is
that they are much more likely to disrupt patient care rather than
be of direct danger to patients.''
Falwell fallout
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell now says Y2K will not be nearly as bad as
his $30 doom-and-gloom video predicts.
   In a fax to the Rev. Steve Hewitt of Raytown, Mo., editor of
Christian Computing magazine, Falwell says:
   ``I've been pleased with the substantial progress that has been
made in both the government and private sector...While I expect Y2K
to be annoying and somewhat disruptive, I do not expect it to be as
serious as some are projecting, or as I first feared possible.''
   Falwell's videotape, ``Y2K: A Christian's Guide to the
Millennium Bug,'' was produced last August. It has since been
pulled from circulation.
Community planning
   Y2K tidbits from the land of community preparedness:
   - The Mid America Assistance Coalition will hold a ``Yearning 2
Know'' session Wednesday at UMKC for social service providers
wanting to learn how Y2K might affect their low-income clients.
Call (816) 561-2727 to register.
   - The Y2K Elected Officials Task Force will convene a Y2K summit
on June 22. Readiness reports will be given from critical service
areas. Call (816) 474-4240 for more information.
   - The Overland Park Chamber of Commerce has produced a ``Year
2000 Survival Guide.'' Non-members can purchase it for $50 by
calling (913) 491-3600.
   - A free Y2K workbook _ ``Are you OK with Y2K'' _ developed by
the Missouri Office of Information Technology is available. Also,
the office is holding one-day workshops throughout the state in
June and September. For more information or to schedule a Y2K
speaker for civic groups, contact the Missouri Y2K Call Center at
1-877-661-4925 or click on www.y2k.state.mo.us
   - The President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion has launched a
``Community Conversations'' campaign to promote local Y2K efforts.
