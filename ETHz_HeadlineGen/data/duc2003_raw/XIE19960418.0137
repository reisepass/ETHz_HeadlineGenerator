NEW DELHI, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The dispute over the sharing of
the Ganges water has become a major hurdle in the relations
between India and Bangladesh, Indian External Affairs Minister
Pranab Mukherjee said today.
However, any problem with Bangladesh could be solved through
bilateral talks, Mukherjee told a press conference in Agartala, in
the far eastern state of Tripura.
Mukherjee was on his campaign trail for the general elections
scheduled to begin on April 27.
India has rejected Bangladesh's repeated demand for an increase
in its share of the Ganges river water.
The Indian government took up the issue of rail communication
through Bangladesh to link India's landlocked Tripura in 1993 but
Bangladesh refused to enter into talks on any issue before the
water dispute was resolved, said Mukherjee.
He noted that improved trade and commerce would benefit both
the two countries, members of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) set up in 1985.
All the seven SAARC countries -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the
Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka -- have agreed to enhance
their economic cooperation by cutting tariffs.
