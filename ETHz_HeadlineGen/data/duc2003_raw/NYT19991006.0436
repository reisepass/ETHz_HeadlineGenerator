Two online car sites want to do for automobiles what eBay has done
for trading cards and Elvis knickknacks: namely, allow consumers to
buy and sell vehicles via online auctions.
   It's unclear, though, whether it's going to work. EBay hasn't
attracted much business since it began officially listing cars in
September.
   Now, Autoweb.com and Autobytel.com said they plan to go far
beyond eBay's car listing by offering more cars, direct relations
with dealers, and money-back guarantees.
   Autoweb, a Santa Clara, Calif., online car site, introduced an
auction service for used cars yesterday. The service is limited to
cars made in 1996 or after with less than 60,000 miles on the
odometer.
   Here is how it works: Participating dealers will provide Autoweb
with a list of cars up for auction. The bidding in this so-called
reserve auction starts at $100 and increases in $50 dollar
increments. A minimum price has to be reached before the dealer
agrees to sell.
   The consumer with the winning bid must take possession of the
car. However, there is a 72-hour grace period for consumers to mull
over their purchases and return the vehicles for a full refund if
they are unhappy.
   ``We want to make the transaction as safe as possible for
consumers and let them determine exactly how much they want to
pay,'' said Norm Turner, a general manager at Autoweb.
   The company launched the service with 14 car dealers in
California and plans to roll out the program to about 50 cities by
next year.
   And while the auctions are now conducted only between dealers
and consumers, Turner said that by December, Autoweb plans to
expand the service to include car owners as sellers.
   Autobytel of Irvine, Calif., which will introduce its auction
service today, hinted yesterday that it will have a more robust and
full-featured offering than Autoweb's.
   Without divulging many details, Autobytel chief operating
officer Ann Delligatta said consumers want an auction service that
allows them to bid on all kinds of used cars, from year-old Hondas
to vintage Cadillacs with more than 100,000 miles.
   She said consumers can expect Autobytel to come out of the gate
with nationwide auctions for both the dealer-to-consumer and
consumer-to-consumer markets. She said the company also may unveil
additional features such as a transportation service for
long-distance transactions.
   Despite the promise, online car auctions are largely unproven. A
random sampling of eBay's car auction site found that the majority
of cars posted there had been sitting idle for a full week without
a single bid.
   ``We're getting about 100 postings a month,'' said eBay
spokesman Kevin Pursglove. ``We still believe the car market will
be strong.''
   There's no denying that the Internet has had a profound impact
on the way Americans buy cars. A 1999 J.D. Power survey reported
that more than 5 million new-vehicle buyers will use the Internet
to gather information before they make a purchase. And Autobytel
estimates that $14 billion worth or new and used cars will be sold
through its site this year.
   The most popular cars sites on the Web are Microsoft CarPoint,
Autobytel, Cars.com, Autoweb and AutoConnect, according to Internet
research firm Media Metrix Inc. So far Autobytel and Autoweb are
the only sites offering auctions.
   Mike Ribiero, who heads up Internet car sales at San Francisco
Honda, believes online car auctions are inevitable. ``Everything is
being auctioned on the Net, so I guess I'm not surprised that cars
are next,'' he said.
