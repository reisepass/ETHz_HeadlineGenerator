   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Chatting on a cell phone while driving
will remain legal in Connecticut.
   After a lengthy debate Thursday, lawmakers used a voice vote to
kill legislation that would have banned the practice.
   Supporters argued the measure, raised as an amendment to a bill
on child safety in motor vehicles, would reduce accidents on
Connecticut roads. Rep. Richard Roy, who sponsored the bill, said
driving with a hand-held phone is as bad as driving drunk.
   ''You're four times more likely to have an accident,'' said Roy,
D-Milford.
   Critics maintained the ban would be difficult to enforce and do
little to improve safety. They said motorists are more distracted
by a host of other activities -- from eating and drinking while
driving to finding a station on the radio.
   Rep. Lawrence Cafero Jr., R-Norwalk, waved a Styrofoam cup of
tea and a bag of candy, and pretended to beat back imaginary
children in the car to illustrate the distractions he faces on a
typical drive.
   ''This doesn't stop all of that,'' he said.
   Some lawmakers said there are already laws on the books that
achieve the goal of the amendment more simply and efficiently.
   ''We have a law to take care of the weaving in and out of
traffic-- it's called reckless driving,'' said Rep. Lee Samowitz,
D-Bridgeport.
   An exception to the ban would have been made for motorists using
their cellular phones to make 911 or other emergency calls. Police
and fire officials would also have been exempt.
   Hands-free cellular phones would have remained legal to use
under the measure.
   There were an estimated 58 million cellular phones in use
nationwide in 1998, Roy said. Statistics show there will be about
80 million by year's end, he said.
   Rep. Steve Fontana, D-North Haven, said the ban would have been
in line with state statutes governing seat belt use, drunken
driving and the safe construction of cars.
   ''We have a precedent to pass such laws,'' he said.
