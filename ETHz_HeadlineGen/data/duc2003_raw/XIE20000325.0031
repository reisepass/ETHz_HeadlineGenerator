JOHANNESBURG, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The South African Truth and
 Reconciliation Commission (TRC) has completely failed to
address or find the root causes for black-on-black violence which
has claimed more than 30, 000 lives in this country, Home Affairs
Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi said on Saturday.
Speaking at the African Renaissance Festival in Durban on the
conflict challenge facing Africa, Buthelezi said the TRC had
achieved some success in investigating and portraying
white-on-black violence and black-on-white violence.
Only time would tell if they had been successful in
reconciling these two groups, he was quoted by South African Press
Association as saying.
"However, in respect of black-on-black violence neither truth
nor reconciliation has been achieved," he said, adding that "the
TRC has not even begun to scratch the surface of black-on-black
violence," Buthelezi said.
The TRC has undergone major setbacks in the research and
understanding of the root causes and dynamics of black-on-black
violence, Buthelezi said.
Some 30,000 people were killed in black-on-black violence and
hundreds of thousands were displaced during the anti-apartheid
struggle. In contrast only 600 whites were killed.
"It is clear that we are far from exposing the picture of what
really happened in our country," Buthelezi said.
Meanwhile, African National Congress leader in KwaZulu-Natal
Province, S'bu Ndebele, said people of Africa were not in
conflict with the rest of world but "in conflict with people of
Africa".
He said violence in KwaZulu-Natal, in which thousands have
died in the past 15 years, could be solved through cooperation by
the political parties -- as was currently being done.
