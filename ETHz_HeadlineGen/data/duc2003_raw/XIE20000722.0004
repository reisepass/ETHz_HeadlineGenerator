WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have found the first
direct evidence for the subatomic particle called the tau neutrino,
the third kind of neutrino known to particle physicists.
The breakthrough, announced Friday, was achieved by an
international collaboration of scientists at the U.S. Department
of Energy's Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory near Chicago.
Although earlier experiments had produced convincing indirect
evidence for the particle's existence, no one had directly
observed the tau neutrino, a massless or almost massless particle
carrying no electric charge and barely interacting with
surrounding matter.
"We finally have direct evidence that the tau neutrino is one
of the building blocks of nature and that it reacts with other
particles in accordance with our current scientific theory of
particle interactions," said Byron Lundberg, spokesman of the
Direct Observation of the Nu Tau (DONUT) experiment, a
collaboration of 54 physicists from the United States, Japan,
Korea, and Greece.
The tau neutrino is the third neutrino of the Standard Model of
elementary particles, a theoretical description that groups all
particles into three generations.
First-generation electron neutrinos and their second-generation
cousins, muon neutrinos, are easier to produce and detect than tau
neutrinos. Experiments identified them in 1956 and 1962 by
recording neutrino interactions creating either electrons or muons.
More than 30 years of technological advancement has now allowed
physicists to observe the third-generation tau neutrino producing
a tau lepton.
In 1997, using Fermilab's Tevatron accelerator, scientists
produced an intense neutrino beam, which they expected to contain
tau neutrinos. The neutrino beam was fired into a 50-foot detector
composed of iron plates coated with an emulsion, which recorded
the particle interactions.
Then the scientists analyzed the 6 million impressions left on
the coating.
The researchers used computer-assisted video cameras to create
a 3-D images of the particle tracks. They narrowed down the field
and found four clear tracks of a tau lepton that scientists say
were caused by tau neutrino collisions.
Stanford University physicist Martin Perl, winner of the 1995
Nobel Prize for discovering the tau lepton, the first indicator
for a third generation of particles, congratulated the DONUT
experiments.
"Finding the tau neutrino is very important and very exciting,"
said Perl. "DONUT was not an easy experiment, and now it opens a
whole new world. There is the possibility of the tau neutrino
interacting somewhat differently from the other neutrinos. We
might have a chance of learning more about all other particles,"
he added.
