WASHINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
European Union (EU) said Tuesday that doing business in Europe
will become more efficient and less costly for American companies
when the euro comes into being in January.
Hugo Paemen, the European Union's ambassador to Washington,
also said the euro would have a substantial impact on the
international monetary system but the dollar would remain its
linchpin for the foreseeable future.
When the euro becomes the common currency of 11 EU nations,
Paemen said, "it will not be a revolution but historically
important" because it will consolidate European integration "in an
irreversible way."
Paemen told reporters that big American companies could benefit
more than European ones when the euro is introduced because they
are more comfortable operating in a large market.
When the European Union created its single market in 1992, he
said, American companies were the first to take advantage, and "we
think that will happen again," Paemen said. "We hope the European
companies will catch up as they did then."
Paemen said major American companies such as Microsoft and
Coca-Cola were prepared for the introduction of the euro because
they have been keeping their books in European currency units, or
ecus, the predecessor of the euro.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises will have a difficult
adjustment period because they don't have the expertise, but the
big ones have done the job," Paemen said.
The new euros will not actually start jingling in people's
pockets until 2002, but the currency once dismissed as a pipedream
of bureaucrats will become a reality.
The euro will trade on international markets against the dollar
and other currencies.
Eleven of the EU's 15 member countries will be using the single
currency starting January 1: Britain, Sweden, Denmark and Greece
have decided to remain outside the euro zone for the time being.
On Friday, European officials will discuss the launching of the
euro with President Clinton and other U.S. officials at the latest
round of the twice-yearly EU-US talks.
