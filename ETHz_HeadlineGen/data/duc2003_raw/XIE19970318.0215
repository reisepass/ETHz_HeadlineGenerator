BUDAPEST, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Czech Prime Minister Vaclav
Klaus today criticized Russia's ambassador to the Czech Republic
for saying that Russia would reconsider its economic relations
with the country if it persisted in trying to join NATO.
He said he was disgusted with the remarks made by Russian
Ambassador Nikolai Rjabov and was waiting to hear what the Russian
government had to say on the issue.
Klaus, who arrived in Budapest today for one-day visit, was
speaking at a joint news briefing with his counterpart, Horn
Gyula.
The Czech prime minister said he hoped the ambassador's remarks
were his personal view. If they reflected the Russian government's
stance, they would only fuel the Czech Republic's desire to join
the western military alliance, he added.
The Czech Republic is one of several former Warsaw Pact nations
who want to join NATO. Leaders of the alliance's member-nations
will decide at a summit in Madrid in July which countries will be
the first to be invited to join.
But Russia is strongly opposed to NATO's eastward expansion
plans, saying the move east will threaten its security.
