   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two-thirds of death penalty cases that were
appealed from 1973 through 1995 were successful, report researchers
who contend the nation's capital punishment system is ''collapsing
under the weight of its own mistakes.''
   A study of 4,578 appeals during those years showed that most
cases ''are so seriously flawed that they have to be done over
again,'' said Columbia University law professor James Liebman, the
lead author.
   ''It's not one case, it's thousands of cases. It's not one
state, it's almost all of the states,'' Liebman said in an
interview. ''You're creating a very high risk that some errors are
going to get through the process.''
   The study comes at a time of increased debate over capital
punishment.
   Earlier this year, Republican Gov. George Ryan of Illinois
imposed a moratorium on capital punishment in his state after 13
death row inmates were exonerated. Texas Gov. George W. Bush
recently approved his first 30-day reprieve in a death penalty case
-- to allow time for DNA testing -- after permitting 131 executions.
   But public support for capital punishment remains high. A Gallup
Poll in February showed 66 percent back the use of death sentences,
down somewhat from Gallup polls during the 1990s that showed
support ranging from 71 percent to 80 percent.
   The Columbia study said only 5 percent of the 5,760 death
sentences imposed from 1973 through 1995 were carried out.
   The study, written with professor Jeffrey Fagan and graduate
student Valerie West, examined 4,578 death penalty cases in which
at least one round of appeals was completed. Of those cases, a
state or federal court threw out the conviction or death sentence
in 68 percent of the cases.
   ''Our 23 years worth of findings reveal a capital punishment
system collapsing under the weight of its own mistakes,'' the study
said.
   Richard Dieter of the Death Penalty Information Center, a group
critical of how capital punishment is administered, said, ''It's
amazing how many mistakes are being made. ... Those supporting the
death penalty might look at it and say this isn't getting us
anywhere.''
   Dudley Sharp of Justice for All, a Houston-based victims' rights
organization, said, ''We all know that these cases get the closest
scrutiny imaginable. ... All systems can be improved and the death
penalty is certainly one of those systems.'' But, he added, there
has been no proof of an innocent person being executed in the past
century.
   The study said the rates of reversals varied widely from state
to state and among federal appellate circuits.
   Texas, which executed 104 people during the study period, showed
52 percent of its death penalty cases reversed on appeal. Florida,
which executed 36 people, had a 73 percent reversal rate.
   On the other hand, Virginia, which executed 29 people, had a
reversal rate of only 18 percent. The study suggested that may be
partly due to Virginia's strict limits on appeals in death penalty
cases and the overall low reversal rate in the 4th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, which hears appeals from that state.
   Liebman said the 68 percent reversal rate appears to have come
down some since 1995. A second study to be released later this year
is expected to look at those numbers, as well as the reasons why
death penalty convictions are thrown out.
   The main reasons appear to be incompetent defense lawyering and
misconduct by prosecutors, the Columbia study said.
   Capital punishment resumed in 1977 after a Supreme Court-imposed
moratorium, and 313 people were executed by the end of 1995. In
recent years, the Supreme Court and Congress have acted to speed up
death penalty reviews in federal courts, and there have been 642
executions to date.
