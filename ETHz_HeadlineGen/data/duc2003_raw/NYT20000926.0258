   WASHINGTON _ Seventy-five years after the Scopes ``Monkey
Trial'' in Tennessee, a scientist's report issued Tuesday gave 13
states failing grades for neglecting to teach evolution.
   Many states do not use the word ``evolution'' in science
standards and one _ Kansas _ has deleted all references to the age
of the Earth or universe.
   The report by Lawrence Lerner, a professor emeritus in the
physics and astronomy department at California State University in
Long Beach, was sponsored by the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation.
Although nonpartisan, the foundation has supported the education
ideas of Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush.
   Lerner presented the paper _ ``The Teaching of Evolution in U.S.
Schools: Where Politics, Religion and Science Converge'' _ at a
day-long forum of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science.
   Evolution ``is not a controversial issue among scientists, nor
among most of the world's educated persons,'' Lerner wrote in the
report. The controversy over evolution ``is not really about
science, but about religion and politics,'' pitting science
educators against those ``who assert that evolution has not taken
place (and) that it is `only fair' to present creationist views to
students in tandem with evolution.''
   In the report, Lerner called creation science ``a
pseudoscientific rival to evolution that the courts have repeatedly
held to be thinly veiled religion.''
   Creation science is teaching that supports the view that the
Earth and humankind were created by God. Evolution, on the other
hand, stems from the scientific theories of 19th century British
naturalist Charles Darwin.
   At a news conference, Lerner said that despite continuing
controversy over evolution, ``the situation is very much in flux I
have high hopes for the future.''
   The education standards enacted in recent years are likely to
lead to competition among the states, he said.
   ``The states tend to vie with each other,'' he said. ``They say
`Jeez, you know, we don't have as high standards as our neighboring
state, let's do something about it.'''
   Speaking at the same news conference, Eugenie Scott, executive
director of the National Center for Science Education Inc., said
the lack of evolution teaching in a state seriously hampers the
scientific education of students in its schools.
   ``Evolution is a basic organizing principle in several
sciences,'' she said. ``It's fact of the universe that change has
taken place; this is shown in astronomy, geology and biology. You
really can't consider yourself to be fully educated if you don't
understand evolution as a part of science.''
   The Lerner report assigns a grade to each state based on how
thoroughly or scantily it treats evolution in science education
standards.
   California, Connecticut, Indiana, New Jersey, North Carolina and
Rhode Island each scores 100. Among other states, Washington
receives an 86 (``brief, straightforward account of evolution'')
and Michigan an 84 (``a well-organized treatment of evolution'').
Both are Bs.
   New York gets a 68 (``this otherwise satisfactory document
suffers from sloppy organization and inclusion of creationist
jargon'') and Texas a 64 (``brief but satisfactory no human
evolution.''). Both are Cs.
   The report reserves its most scathing reviews for states
receiving an ``F'': Wyoming, Maine, Ohio, Oklahoma, New Hampshire,
Florida, Alabama, North Dakota, Georgia, Mississippi, West
Virginia, Kansas and Tennessee.
   ``It seems the Scopes trial is still under way in Tennessee,''
the report says. ``None of the sketchy biology coverage makes
sense.''
   The Lerner gives its lowest grade _ F-minus _ to Kansas. The
state's educational standard ``avoids all discussion of the age of
the Earth or the universe, or any other topic touching on the
history of the Earth or universe,'' the report says.
   The Kansas board of education voted to drop evolution from state
science standards last year. But board elections this November are
very likely to change the panel from support of creationism to
support of evolution.
   Asked about the report's ranking of Kansas, state education
department spokeswoman Kathy Toelkes said ``I don't have any
comment on it other than I don't think we're surprised.''
   The famous trial of science teacher John Scopes took place 75
years ago in Dayton, Tenn. With fiery orator and ex-presidential
contender William Jennings Bryan as prosecutor and celebrated
Chicago lawyer Clarence Darrow for the defense, the trial came to
symbolize the clash between modern scientific ideas and traditional
religion in 20th Century America.
   Scopes deliberately violated a Tennessee state law that barred
the teaching of evolution. Despite Darrow's impassioned defense,
the teacher was convicted of violating the law. But the conviction
was overturned on appeal. Scopes died in 1970.
