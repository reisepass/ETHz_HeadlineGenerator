	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Interpol on Monday approved an Egyptian
proposal that calls on police agencies to share information as part
of the international fight against terrorism.
	   The agency separately revised its guidelines for combating
terrorism.
	   While Interpol officials refused to reveal details of their new
counter-terrorism strategy, they emphasized that member states
should share information on wanted terrorists.
	   The decisions taken during the 67th General Assembly of Interpol
``send a clear message to all countries who support terrorism or
help in financing'' terrorist operations, said Serageddin Rabie,
Interpol's vice president for the Middle East and Africa.
	   The meeting of international police officials brought together
some 500 delegates from 140 member states.
	   The Egyptian proposal ratified by the assembly calls for
increased cooperation to fight terrorism and the holding of an
international conference on terrorism.
	   The proposal stressed the need to ``overcome obstacles impeding
the handing over of terrorists,'' Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
	   Egypt, which has suffered major attacks from Islamic militants,
has been lobbying for such a summit, arguing that terrorism is a
global phenomenon.
	   Late last year, Islamic militants killed 67 tourists in two
separate attacks.
	   The assembly also admitted the Comoro Islands as a new member,
and agreed to hold its 1999 meeting in Seoul, South Korea.
