   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- The desert nation of Mozambique, still recovering
from recent devastating and deadly rains, is bracing for another watery
onslaught.
	   A tropical storm is heading to the country and expected to bring heavy rains
and high winds, the South African Weather Bureau in Pretoria said Sunday. It was
uncertain when the system would hit land.
	   The Mozambican floods are reported to have killed 150 people and left
hundreds of thousands homeless.
	   Vast areas of agricultural land have been destroyed in the floods, leading
to acute hunger, Radio Mozambique reported Saturday. But President Joaquim
Chissano, who inspected flood damages by air Saturday in southern Mozambique,
said this year's harvest in the Limpopo Valley did not have to be totally
ruined.
	   ``Everything would depend on an efficient supply of seeds to farmers for
second sowings,'' he said.
	   Crews from South African Defense Forces, in Mozambique to aid the rescue
effort, have saved about 3,000 people from trees, rooftops and the water in the
past week, spokesman Maj. Louis Kirstein said Sunday.
	   In southern Namibia, about 5,000 people were displaced when the Fish River
burst its banks after officials on Saturday were forced to open the sluice gates
of the country's largest storage dam because of torrential rains and flash
floods.
	   Botswana has also been drenched by heavy floods.
