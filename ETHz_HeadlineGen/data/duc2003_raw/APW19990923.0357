	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- The Republican and Democratic  
presidential candidates are being invited to a series of televised 
debates in New Hampshire in the weeks before the nation's first 
primary. 
	The New Hampshire Primary Debate Partnership has scheduled two  
rounds of debates before live audiences at the University of New 
Hampshire. 
	The first would feature Republican candidates on Jan. 7 and  
Democrats on Jan. 14. The second would lead off with the Democrats 
on Feb. 2, followed by the Republicans the next day. 
	WMUR-TV and CNN also are sponsoring presidential debates on the  
same dates in February, but their schedule is reversed. Their plan 
is to have the Republicans on Feb. 2 and Democrats on Feb. 3 
	New Hampshire's primary is scheduled for Feb. 8.  
	The New Hampshire Primary Debate Partnership is comprised of The  
Union Leader, New England Cable News and New Hampshire Public 
Television. The Associated Press and WNDS-TV are among the 
associate sponsors. 
	The partnership's debates will be televised on New England Cable  
News, New Hampshire Public Television, an NBC affiliate, and either 
MSNBC or CNBC. PBS will offer a live feed, which is expected to be 
picked up by stations in other states with early primaries. 
	WNDS-TV and C-SPAN will host a forum on Oct. 18 that will  
include candidates from both parties. 
	WMUR and CNN are sponsoring candidate forums on Oct. 27 and 28.
